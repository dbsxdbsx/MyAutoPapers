| **1** | **[Adaptive Data Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12620v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We introduce ADEPT: Adaptive Data ExPloiTation, a simple yet powerful framework to enhance the **data efficiency** and **generalization** in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, ADEPT adaptively manages the use of sampled data across different learning stages via multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms, optimizing data utilization while mitigating overfitting. Moreover, ADEPT can significantly reduce the computational overhead and accelerate a wide range of RL algorithms. We test ADEPT on benchmarks including Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive simulation demonstrates that ADEPT can achieve superior performance with remarkable computational efficiency, offering a practical solution to data-efficient RL.

| **2** | **[SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps. In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but significantly more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality in Reinforcement Learning Through Approximate Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07591v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which refers to the fact that large-scale problems often lead to exponentially high sample complexity. A common solution is to use deep neural networks for function approximation; however, such approaches typically lack theoretical guarantees. To provably address the curse of dimensionality, we observe that many real-world problems exhibit task-specific model structures that, when properly leveraged, can improve the sample efficiency of RL. Building on this insight, we propose overcoming the curse of dimensionality by approximately factorizing the original Markov decision processes (MDPs) into smaller, independently evolving MDPs. This factorization enables the development of sample-efficient RL algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings, with the latter involving a variant of variance-reduced Q-learning. We provide improved sample complexity guarantees for both proposed algorithms. Notably, by leveraging model structure through the approximate factorization of the MDP, the dependence of sample complexity on the size of the state-action space can be exponentially reduced. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our proposed methods through experiments on both synthetic MDP tasks and a wind farm-equipped storage control problem.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Precise and Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21845v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for enabling autonomous acquisition of complex robotic manipulation skills, but realizing this potential in real-world settings has been challenging. We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

| **5** | **[On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19989v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Appendix: \url{https://tinyurl.com/gcr-appendix-2}.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Uncovering RL Integration in SSL Loss: Objective-Specific Implications for Data-Efficient RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17428v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this study, we investigate the effect of SSL objective modifications within the SPR framework, focusing on specific adjustments such as terminal state masking and prioritized replay weighting, which were not explicitly addressed in the original design. While these modifications are specific to RL, they are not universally applicable across all RL algorithms. Therefore, we aim to assess their impact on performance and explore other SSL objectives that do not accommodate these adjustments like Barlow Twins and VICReg. We evaluate six SPR variants on the Atari 100k benchmark, including versions both with and without these modifications. Additionally, we test the performance of these objectives on the DeepMind Control Suite, where such modifications are absent. Our findings reveal that incorporating specific SSL modifications within SPR significantly enhances performance, and this influence extends to subsequent frameworks like SR-SPR and BBF, highlighting the critical importance of SSL objective selection and related adaptations in achieving data efficiency in self-predictive reinforcement learning.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[EfficientZero V2: Mastering Discrete and Continuous Control with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00564v2)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Sample efficiency remains a crucial challenge in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world tasks. While recent algorithms have made significant strides in improving sample efficiency, none have achieved consistently superior performance across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce EfficientZero V2, a general framework designed for sample-efficient RL algorithms. We have expanded the performance of EfficientZero to multiple domains, encompassing both continuous and discrete actions, as well as visual and low-dimensional inputs. With a series of improvements we propose, EfficientZero V2 outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a significant margin in diverse tasks under the limited data setting. EfficientZero V2 exhibits a notable advancement over the prevailing general algorithm, DreamerV3, achieving superior outcomes in 50 of 66 evaluated tasks across diverse benchmarks, such as Atari 100k, Proprio Control, and Vision Control.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Brain-Like Replay Naturally Emerges in Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01467v2)** | 2024-02-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Replay is a powerful strategy to promote learning in artificial intelligence and the brain. However, the conditions to generate it and its functional advantages have not been fully recognized. In this study, we develop a modular reinforcement learning model that could generate replay. We prove that replay generated in this way helps complete the task. We also analyze the information contained in the representation and provide a mechanism for how replay makes a difference. Our design avoids complex assumptions and enables replay to emerge naturally within a task-optimized paradigm. Our model also reproduces key phenomena observed in biological agents. This research explores the structural biases in modular ANN to generate replay and its potential utility in developing efficient RL.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[RL$^3$: Boosting Meta Reinforcement Learning via RL inside RL$^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15909v5)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods such as RL$^2$ have emerged as promising approaches for learning data-efficient RL algorithms tailored to a given task distribution. However, they show poor asymptotic performance and struggle with out-of-distribution tasks because they rely on sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers, to process experiences rather than summarize them using general-purpose RL components such as value functions. In contrast, traditional RL algorithms are data-inefficient as they do not use domain knowledge, but do converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We propose RL$^3$, a principled hybrid approach that incorporates action-values, learned per task via traditional RL, in the inputs to meta-RL. We show that RL$^3$ earns greater cumulative reward in the long term compared to RL$^2$ while drastically reducing meta-training time and generalizes better to out-of-distribution tasks. Experiments are conducted on both custom and benchmark discrete domains from the meta-RL literature that exhibit a range of short-term, long-term, and complex dependencies.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Multinomial Logistic Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13540v2)** | 2022-12-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study model-based reinforcement learning (RL) for episodic Markov decision processes (MDP) whose transition probability is parametrized by an unknown transition core with features of state and action. Despite much recent progress in analyzing algorithms in the linear MDP setting, the understanding of more general transition models is very restrictive. In this paper, we establish a provably efficient RL algorithm for the MDP whose state transition is given by a multinomial logistic model. To balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, we propose an upper confidence bound-based algorithm. We show that our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 T})$ regret bound where $d$ is the dimension of the transition core, $H$ is the horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm with multinomial logistic function approximation with provable guarantees. We also comprehensively evaluate our proposed algorithm numerically and show that it consistently outperforms the existing methods, hence achieving both provable efficiency and practical superior performance.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Microservice Deployment in Space Computing Power Networks via Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06244v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>With the growing demand for Earth observation, it is important to provide reliable real-time remote sensing inference services to meet the low-latency requirements. The Space Computing Power Network (Space-CPN) offers a promising solution by providing onboard computing and extensive coverage capabilities for real-time inference. This paper presents a remote sensing artificial intelligence applications deployment framework designed for Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations to achieve real-time inference performance. The framework employs the microservice architecture, decomposing monolithic inference tasks into reusable, independent modules to address high latency and resource heterogeneity. This distributed approach enables optimized microservice deployment, minimizing resource utilization while meeting quality of service and functional requirements. We introduce Robust Optimization to the deployment problem to address data uncertainty. Additionally, we model the Robust Optimization problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and propose a robust reinforcement learning algorithm to handle the semi-infinite Quality of Service constraints. Our approach yields sub-optimal solutions that minimize accuracy loss while maintaining acceptable computational costs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[A New Interpretation of the Certainty-Equivalence Approach for PAC Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v1)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Partially Observed Optimal Stochastic Control: Regularity, Optimality, Approximations, and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06735v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Hierarchical Object-Oriented POMDP Planning for Object Rearrangement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01348v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present an online planning framework for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. We evaluate our system on varying numbers of objects, rooms, and problem types in AI2-THOR simulated environments with promising results.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Near Optimal Approximations and Finite Memory Policies for POMPDs with Continuous Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02895v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study an approximation method for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with continuous spaces. Belief MDP reduction, which has been the standard approach to study POMDPs requires rigorous approximation methods for practical applications, due to the state space being lifted to the space of probability measures. Generalizing recent work, in this paper we present rigorous approximation methods via discretizing the observation space and constructing a fully observed finite MDP model using a finite length history of the discrete observations and control actions. We show that the resulting policy is near-optimal under some regularity assumptions on the channel, and under certain controlled filter stability requirements for the hidden state process. Furthermore, by quantizing the measurements, we are able to utilize refined filter stability conditions. We also provide a Q learning algorithm that uses a finite memory of discretized information variables, and prove its convergence to the optimality equation of the finite fully observed MDP constructed using the approximation method.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00120v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reward Machines provide an automaton-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing the underlying structure of a reward function, they enable the decomposition of an RL task, leading to impressive gains in sample efficiency. Although Reward Machines and similar formal specifications have a rich history of application towards sequential decision-making problems, they critically rely on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that forms the building blocks of the reward function--such ground-truth interpretations are elusive in the real world due in part to partial observability and noisy sensing. In this work, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that exploit task structure under uncertain interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary. Through theory and experiments, we expose pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem while simultaneously demonstrating how task structure can be successfully leveraged under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[AutoMix: Automatically Mixing Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12963v5)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now available from cloud API providers in various sizes and configurations. While this diversity offers a broad spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we present Automix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to Automix are two key technical contributions. First, it has a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring extensive training. Second, given that self-verification can be noisy, it employs a POMDP based router that can effectively select an appropriately sized model, based on answer confidence. Experiments across five language models and five challenging datasets show that Automix consistently surpasses strong baselines, reducing computational cost by over 50% for comparable performance.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Experimental Study on The Effect of Multi-step Deep Reinforcement Learning in POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04999v2)** | 2022-09-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made tremendous advances in both simulated and real-world robot control tasks in recent years. This is particularly the case for tasks that can be carefully engineered with a full state representation, and which can then be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, applying DRL strategies designed for MDPs to novel robot control tasks can be challenging, because the available observations may be a partial representation of the state, resulting in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This paper considers three popular DRL algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), invented for MDPs, and studies their performance in POMDP scenarios. While prior work has found that SAC and TD3 typically outperform PPO across a broad range of tasks that can be represented as MDPs, we show that this is not always the case, using three representative POMDP environments. Empirical studies show that this is related to multi-step bootstrapping, where multi-step immediate rewards, instead of one-step immediate reward, are used to calculate the target value estimation of an observation and action pair. We identify this by observing that the inclusion of multi-step bootstrapping in TD3 (MTD3) and SAC (MSAC) results in improved robustness in POMDP settings.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01114v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459v2)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/dyunis/subwords_as_skills}.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Language Reward Modulation for Pretraining Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12270v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Using learned reward functions (LRFs) as a means to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has yielded some steady progress in task-complexity through the years. In this work, we question whether today's LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Exploiting Transformer in Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Temporal Logic Motion Planning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3290511)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Automaton based approaches have enabled robots to perform various complex tasks. However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.</p></details> |

To improve learning efficiency for such tasks, this paper proposes a DRL exploration technique, termed A^2, which integrates two components inspired by human experiences: Abstract demonstrations and Adaptive exploration. A^2 starts by decomposing a complex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to learn. During training, the agent explores the environment adaptively, acting more deterministically for well-mastered subtasks and more stochastically for ill-learnt subtasks. Ablation and comparative experiments are conducted on several grid-world tasks and three robotic manipulation tasks. We demonstrate that A^2 can aid popular DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, and SAC) to learn more efficiently and stably in these environments.</p></details> |

But in some problems, prior knowledge can be used to augment the learning process. Reward shaping is a way to incorporate prior knowledge into the original reward function in order to speed up the learning. While previous work has investigated the use of expert knowledge to generate potential functions, in this work, we study whether we can use a search algorithm(A*) to automatically generate a potential function for reward shaping in Sokoban, a well-known planning task. The results showed that learning with shaped reward function is faster than learning from scratch. Our results indicate that distance functions could be a suitable function for Sokoban. This work demonstrates the possibility of solving multiple instances with the help of reward shaping. The result can be compressed into a single policy, which can be seen as the first phrase towards training a general policy that is able to solve unseen instances.</p></details> |

In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible objects interactions are supposed to "feel" like. We encourage exploration by rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don't match. In our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other curiosity-based methods and find that our method performs better and is more sample-efficient.</p></details> |

In order to be sample efficient, multi-task learning requires reuse and sharing of low-level policies. To facilitate the automatic decomposition of hierarchical tasks, we propose the use of step-by-step human demonstrations in the form of natural language instructions and action trajectories. We introduce a dataset of such demonstrations in a crafting-based grid world. Our model consists of a high-level language generator and low-level policy, conditioned on language. We find that human demonstrations help solve the most complex tasks. We also find that incorporating natural language allows the model to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and to learn quickly from a few demonstrations. Generalization is not only reflected in the actions of the agent, but also in the generated natural language instructions in unseen tasks. Our approach also gives our trained agent interpretable behaviors because it is able to generate a sequence of high-level descriptions of its actions.</p></details> |

Classic methods rely on getting feedback via extrinsic rewards to train the agent, and in situations where this occurs very rarely the agent learns slowly or cannot learn at all. Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that create suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely stop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary target for the Q-function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that (1) plans exploration actions far into the future by using a long-term visitation count, and (2) decouples exploration and exploitation by learning a separate function assessing the exploration value of the actions. Contrary to existing methods which use models of reward and dynamics, our approach is off-policy and model-free. We further propose new tabular environments for benchmarking exploration in reinforcement learning. Empirical results on classic and novel benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in environments with sparse rewards, especially in the presence of rewards that create suboptimal modes of the objective function. Results also suggest that our approach scales gracefully with the size of the environment. Source code is available at https://github.com/sparisi/visit-value-explore</p></details> |

In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few records are available for each patient, and patients may show different responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real (possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Causal Discovery via Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14997v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Existing score-based methods for directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning from observational data struggle to recover the causal graph accurately and sample-efficiently. To overcome this, in this study, we propose DrBO (DAG recovery via Bayesian Optimization)-a novel DAG learning framework leveraging Bayesian optimization (BO) to find high-scoring DAGs. We show that, by sophisticatedly choosing the promising DAGs to explore, we can find higher-scoring ones much more efficiently. To address the scalability issues of conventional BO in DAG learning, we replace Gaussian Processes commonly employed in BO with dropout neural networks, trained in a continual manner, which allows for (i) flexibly modeling the DAG scores without overfitting, (ii) incorporation of uncertainty into the estimated scores, and (iii) scaling with the number of evaluations. As a result, DrBO is computationally efficient and can find the accurate DAG in fewer trials and less time than existing state-of-the-art methods. This is demonstrated through an extensive set of empirical evaluations on many challenging settings with both synthetic and real data. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/baosws/DrBO.</p></details> |

These phenomena violate the stable unit treatment value assumption and pose significant challenges in causal inference. To address these complexities, we propose a minimax optimal experimental design that simultaneously accounts for both spillover and carryover effects, enhancing the precision of estimates for direct and spillover effects. This method is particularly applicable to multi-unit experiments, reducing sample size requirements and experimental costs. We also investigate the asymptotic properties of the Horvitz--Thompson estimators of direct and spillover effects, demonstrating their consistency and asymptotic normality under the minimax optimal design. To facilitate valid inferences, we propose conservative variance estimators. Furthermore, we tackle the challenges associated with potential misspecifications in the order of carryover effects. Our approach is validated by comprehensive numerical studies that demonstrate superior performance compared to existing experimental designs.</p></details> |

Large-scale nonlinear and possibly irreversible changes in system state, such as AMOC weakening or rainforest-savanna transitions in the Amazon basin, would have severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies worldwide. In order to improve future tipping risk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is crucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone, potentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its stability. However, AMOC-AR interactions are currently not well understood. Here, we identify a previously unknown stabilising interaction pathway from the AMOC onto the Southern AR, applying an established causal discovery and inference approach to tipping element interactions for the first time. Analysing observational and reanalysis data from 1982-2022, we show that AMOC weakening leads to increased precipitation in the Southern AR during the critical dry season, in line with findings from recent Earth system model experiments. Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season precipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding is consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show that this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation decrease in the Southern AR since 1982. Our results demonstrate the potential of causal discovery methods for analysing tipping element interactions based on reanalysis and observational data. By improving the understanding of AMOC-AR interactions, we contribute toward better constraining the risk of potential climate tipping cascades under global warming.</p></details> |

Borrowing domain adaptation principles, a popular design maps the sample representation to a latent space that balances control and treated populations while enabling the prediction of the potential outcomes. This paper presents a new CATE estimation approach based on the asymmetrical search for two latent spaces called Asymmetrical Latent Representation for Individual Treatment Effect (ALRITE), where the two latent spaces are respectively intended to optimize the counterfactual prediction accuracy on the control and the treated samples. Under moderate assumptions, ALRITE admits an upper bound on the precision of the estimation of heterogeneous effects (PEHE), and the approach is empirically successfully validated compared to the state-of-the-art</p></details> |

By introducing the assumption that error terms follow a multivariate generalized normal distribution, our method leverages continuous optimization techniques to recover acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), including causal directions rather than just equivalence classes. We provide theoretical guarantees on the identifiability of causal parameters and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and applications to real-world datasets.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[REX: Causal Discovery based on Machine Learning and Explainability techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12706v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Explainability techniques hold significant potential for enhancing the causal discovery process, which is crucial for understanding complex systems in areas like healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce REX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that REX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, REX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase REX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, REX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures. REX is publicly available at https://github.com/renero/causalgraph.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Identification of Nonparametric Dynamic Causal Structure and Latent Process in Climate System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12500v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The study of learning causal structure with latent variables has advanced the understanding of the world by uncovering causal relationships and latent factors, e.g., Causal Representation Learning (CRL). However, in real-world scenarios, such as those in climate systems, causal relationships are often nonparametric, dynamic, and exist among both observed variables and latent variables. These challenges motivate us to consider a general setting in which causal relations are nonparametric and unrestricted in their occurrence, which is unconventional to current methods. To solve this problem, with the aid of 3-measurement in temporal structure, we theoretically show that both latent variables and processes can be identified up to minor indeterminacy under mild assumptions. Moreover, we tackle the general nonlinear Causal Discovery (CD) from observations, e.g., temperature, as a specific task of learning independent representation, through the principle of functional equivalence. Based on these insights, we develop an estimation approach simultaneously recovering both the observed causal structure and latent causal process in a nontrivial manner. Simulation studies validate the theoretical foundations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In the experiments involving climate data, this approach offers a powerful and in-depth understanding of the climate system.</p></details> |

This is a fully quantum version of what causal inference researchers refer to as the problem of causal discovery. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of the inflation technique for causal inference, which leverages the quantum marginal problem. We illustrate the utility of this method using a simple example: testing compatibility of tripartite quantum states with the quantum network known as the triangle scenario. We show, in particular, how the method yields a complete classification of pure three-qubit states into those that are and those that are not compatible with the triangle scenario. We also provide some illustrative examples involving mixed states and some where one or more of the systems is higher-dimensional. Finally, we examine the question of when the incompatibility of a multipartite quantum state with a causal structure can be inferred from the incompatibility of a joint probability distribution induced by implementing measurements on each subsystem.</p></details> |

By automating debiased estimation and inference procedures in causal inference and semiparametric statistics, our framework enables practitioners to construct valid estimators for complex parameters without requiring specialized expertise. The framework supports Neyman-orthogonal loss functions with unknown nuisance parameters requiring data-driven estimation, as well as vector-valued M-estimands involving simultaneous loss minimization across multiple Hilbert space models. We formalize the class of parameters efficiently estimable by autoDML as a novel class of nonparametric projection parameters, defined via orthogonal minimum loss objectives. We introduce three autoDML estimators based on one-step estimation, targeted minimum loss-based estimation, and the method of sieves. For data-driven model selection, we derive a novel decomposition of model approximation error for smooth functionals of M-estimands and propose adaptive debiased machine learning estimators that are superefficient and adaptive to the functional form of the M-estimand. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of our framework by constructing autoDML estimators for the long-term survival under a beta-geometric model.</p></details> |

It aims to identify the root causes of system performance anomalies, allowing the resolution or the future prevention of issues that can cause millions of dollars in losses. Common existing approaches relying on data correlation or full domain expert knowledge are inaccurate or infeasible in most industrial cases, since correlation does not imply causation, and domain experts may not have full knowledge of complex and real-time systems. In this work, we define a novel causal domain knowledge model representing causal relations about the underlying system components to allow domain experts to contribute partial domain knowledge for root cause analysis. We then introduce RADICE, an algorithm that through the causal graph discovery, enhancement, refinement, and subtraction processes is able to output a root cause causal sub-graph showing the causal relations between the system components affected by the anomaly. We evaluated RADICE with simulated data and reported a real data use case, sharing the lessons we learned. The experiments show that RADICE provides better results than other baseline methods, including causal discovery algorithms and correlation based approaches for root cause analysis.</p></details> |

However, limited attention has been given to utilizing explainability methods to improve model performance. In this paper, we propose to leverage counterfactual concepts aiming to enhance the performance of CNN models in image classification tasks. Our proposed approach utilizes counterfactual reasoning to identify crucial filters used in the decision-making process. Following this, we perform model retraining through the design of a novel methodology and loss functions that encourage the activation of class-relevant important filters and discourage the activation of irrelevant filters for each class. This process effectively minimizes the deviation of activation patterns of local predictions and the global activation patterns of their respective inferred classes. By incorporating counterfactual explanations, we validate unseen model predictions and identify misclassifications. The proposed methodology provides insights into potential weaknesses and biases in the model's learning process, enabling targeted improvements and enhanced performance. Experimental results on publicly available datasets have demonstrated an improvement of 1-2\%, validating the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |

However, inferring causal links from observational data, namely without direct manipulations of the system, is still computationally challenging, especially if the data are high-dimensional. In this study we introduce a framework for constructing causal graphs from high-dimensional time series, whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. The approach is based on the automatic identification of dynamical communities, groups of variables which mutually influence each other and can therefore be described as a single node in a causal graph. These communities are efficiently identified by optimizing the Information Imbalance, a statistical quantity that assigns a weight to each putative causal variable based on its information content relative to a target variable. The communities are then ordered starting from the fully autonomous ones, whose evolution is independent from all the others, to those that are progressively dependent on other communities, building in this manner a community causal graph. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of our approach on time-discrete and time-continuous dynamical systems including up to 80 variables.</p></details> |

Bootstrapping with replacement can be computationally expensive and problematic when cross-validation is used in the estimation algorithm due to duplicate observations in the bootstrap samples. We provide a valid, fast, easy-to-implement subsampling bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for asymptotically linear estimators and discuss its application to semiparametric causal inference. Our method, inspired by the Cheap Bootstrap (Lam, 2022), leverages the quantiles of a t-distribution and has the desired coverage with few bootstrap replications. We show that the method is asymptotically valid if the subsample size is chosen appropriately as a function of the sample size. We illustrate our method with data from the LEADER trial (Marso et al., 2016), obtaining confidence intervals for a longitudinal targeted minimum loss-based estimator (van der Laan and Gruber, 2012). Through a series of empirical experiments, we also explore the impact of subsample size, sample size, and the number of bootstrap repetitions on the performance of the confidence interval.</p></details> |
| **15** | **[SpaceTime: Causal Discovery from Non-Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10235v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Understanding causality is challenging and often complicated by changing causal relationships over time and across environments. Climate patterns, for example, shift over time with recurring seasonal trends, while also depending on geographical characteristics such as ecosystem variability. Existing methods for discovering causal graphs from time series either assume stationarity, do not permit both temporal and spatial distribution changes, or are unaware of locations with the same causal relationships. In this work, we therefore unify the three tasks of causal graph discovery in the non-stationary multi-context setting, of reconstructing temporal regimes, and of partitioning datasets and time intervals into those where invariant causal relationships hold. To construct a consistent score that forms the basis of our method, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle. Our resulting algorithm SPACETIME simultaneously accounts for heterogeneity across space and non-stationarity over time. Given multiple time series, it discovers regime changepoints and a temporal causal graph using non-parametric functional modeling and kernelized discrepancy testing. We also show that our method provides insights into real-world phenomena such as river-runoff measured at different catchments and biosphere-atmosphere interactions across ecosystems.</p></details> |

However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.</p></details> |

In this regard, we propose a novel method for generating interpretable counterfactual and contrastive explanations for DCNN models. The proposed method is model intrusive that probes the internal workings of a DCNN instead of altering the input image to generate explanations. Given an input image, we provide contrastive explanations by identifying the most important filters in the DCNN representing features and concepts that separate the model's decision between classifying the image to the original inferred class or some other specified alter class. On the other hand, we provide counterfactual explanations by specifying the minimal changes necessary in such filters so that a contrastive output is obtained. Using these identified filters and concepts, our method can provide contrastive and counterfactual reasons behind a model's decisions and makes the model more transparent. One of the interesting applications of this method is misclassification analysis, where we compare the identified concepts from a particular input image and compare them with class-specific concepts to establish the validity of the model's decisions. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art and evaluated on the Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB) 2011 dataset to show the usefulness of the explanations provided.</p></details> |

While integrating conformal prediction with causal inference can provide valid uncertainty quantification for ITEs, the resulting prediction intervals are often excessively wide, limiting their practical utility. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{S}urrogate-assisted \underline{C}onformal \underline{I}nference for \underline{E}fficient I\underline{N}dividual \underline{C}ausal \underline{E}ffects (SCIENCE), a framework designed to construct more efficient prediction intervals for ITEs. SCIENCE accommodates the covariate shifts between source data and target data and applies to various data configurations, including semi-supervised and surrogate-assisted semi-supervised learning. Leveraging semi-parametric efficiency theory, SCIENCE produces rate double-robust prediction intervals under mild rate convergence conditions, permitting the use of flexible non-parametric models to estimate nuisance functions. We quantify efficiency gains by comparing semi-parametric efficiency bounds with and without the surrogates. Simulation studies demonstrate that our surrogate-assisted intervals offer substantial efficiency improvements over existing methods while maintaining valid group-conditional coverage. Applied to the phase 3 Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine trial, SCIENCE illustrates how multiple surrogate markers can be leveraged to generate more efficient prediction intervals.</p></details> |

We construct OccludeNet, a large-scale occluded video dataset that includes both real-world and synthetic occlusion scene videos under various natural environments. OccludeNet features dynamic tracking occlusion, static scene occlusion, and multi-view interactive occlusion, addressing existing gaps in data. Our analysis reveals that occlusion impacts action classes differently, with actions involving low scene relevance and partial body visibility experiencing greater accuracy degradation. To overcome the limitations of current occlusion-focused approaches, we propose a structural causal model for occluded scenes and introduce the Causal Action Recognition (CAR) framework, which employs backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning. This framework enhances key actor information, improving model robustness to occlusion. We anticipate that the challenges posed by OccludeNet will stimulate further exploration of causal relations in occlusion scenarios and encourage a reevaluation of class correlations, ultimately promoting sustainable performance improvements. The code and full dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |

Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</p></details> |

Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the scarcity of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training distribution. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically requires huge amounts of data to prevent neural network policies from picking up on spurious correlations and learning non-causal relationships. We propose CAIAC, a data augmentation method that can create feasible synthetic transitions from a fixed dataset without having access to online environment interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying causal influence, we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping $\it{action}$-unaffected parts of the state-space between independent trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness of offline learning algorithms against distributional shift.</p></details> |

However, when outcomes are latent variables assessed via psychometric instruments such as educational tests, standard methods ignore the potential HTE that may exist among the individual items of the outcome measure. Failing to account for "item-level" HTE (IL-HTE) can lead to both underestimated standard errors and identification challenges in the estimation of treatment-by-covariate interaction effects. We demonstrate how Item Response Theory (IRT) models that estimate a treatment effect for each assessment item can both address these challenges and provide new insights into HTE generally. This study articulates the theoretical rationale for the IL-HTE model and demonstrates its practical value using 75 datasets from 48 randomized controlled trials containing 5.8 million item responses in economics, education, and health research. Our results show that the IL-HTE model reveals item-level variation masked by single-number scores, provides more meaningful standard errors in many settings, allows for estimates of the generalizability of causal effects to untested items, resolves identification problems in the estimation of interaction effects, and provides estimates of standardized treatment effect sizes corrected for attenuation due to measurement error.</p></details> |

This is particularly useful in fields like environmental and ecological sciences, where interventional data are usually not available. Structural causal models are probabilistic models for causal analysis that simplify this kind of reasoning due to their graphical representation. They can be regarded as extensions of the so-called Bayesian networks, a well known modeling tool commonly used in environmental and ecological problems. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the relations of necessity and sufficiency between the variables of a socioecological system using counterfactual reasoning with Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider a case study involving socioeconomic factors and land-uses in southern Spain. In addition, this paper aims to be a coherent overview of the fundamental concepts for applying counterfactual reasoning, so that environmental researchers with a background in Bayesian networks can easily take advantage of the structural causal model formalism.</p></details> |

We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process, which introduces focalism. This trade-off between unconfoundedness and ecological validity is usually absent in traditional experimental design and represents a unique challenge in LLM simulations. We formalize this challenge theoretically, showing it stems from ambiguous prompting strategies, and hence cannot be fully addressed by improving training data or by fine-tuning. Alternative approaches that unblind the experimental design to the LLM show promise. Our findings suggest that effectively leveraging LLMs for experimental simulations requires fundamentally rethinking established experimental design practices rather than simply adapting protocols developed for human subjects.</p></details> |

We show how, in a setting with repeated experiments, Bayesian hierarchical modeling yields an adaptive procedure that uses the data to determine how much adjustment to perform. The result is a novel analysis with increased statistical efficiency compared to the default analysis based on difference estimates. We demonstrate this procedure on two real examples, as well as on a series of simulated datasets. We show that the increased efficiency can have real-world consequences in terms of the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. We also discuss the relevance of this work to causal inference and statistical design and analysis more generally.</p></details> |

While prior methods employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous encoding, they often struggle to capture the complexity of video data, relying on simple coordinate concatenation and pre-trained optical flow network for motion representation. Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve-and even degrade performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM performance, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.</p></details> |

We present DiffVSR, a diffusion-based framework for real-world video super-resolution that effectively addresses these challenges through key innovations. For intra-sequence coherence, we develop a multi-scale temporal attention module and temporal-enhanced VAE decoder that capture fine-grained motion details. To ensure inter-sequence stability, we introduce a noise rescheduling mechanism with an interweaved latent transition approach, which enhances temporal consistency without additional training overhead. We propose a progressive learning strategy that transitions from simple to complex degradations, enabling robust optimization despite limited high-quality video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVSR delivers superior results in both visual quality and temporal consistency, setting a new performance standard in real-world video super-resolution.</p></details> |

However, these models struggle to maintain temporal consistency, as they are trained on static images, limiting their ability to capture temporal dynamics effectively. Integrating text-to-video (T2V) models into video super-resolution for improved temporal modeling is straightforward. However, two key challenges remain: artifacts introduced by complex degradations in real-world scenarios, and compromised fidelity due to the strong generative capacity of powerful T2V models (\textit{e.g.}, CogVideoX-5B). To enhance the spatio-temporal quality of restored videos, we introduce\textbf{~\name} (\textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{A}ugmentation with T2V models for \textbf{R}eal-world video super-resolution), a novel approach that leverages T2V models for real-world video super-resolution, achieving realistic spatial details and robust temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce a Local Information Enhancement Module (LIEM) before the global attention block to enrich local details and mitigate degradation artifacts. Moreover, we propose a Dynamic Frequency (DF) Loss to reinforce fidelity, guiding the model to focus on different frequency components across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate\textbf{~\name}~outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Compressed Domain Prior-Guided Video Super-Resolution for Cloud Gaming Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01773v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Cloud gaming is an advanced form of Internet service that necessitates local terminals to decode within limited resources and time latency. Super-Resolution (SR) techniques are often employed on these terminals as an efficient way to reduce the required bit-rate bandwidth for cloud gaming. However, insufficient attention has been paid to SR of compressed game video content. Most SR networks amplify block artifacts and ringing effects in decoded frames while ignoring edge details of game content, leading to unsatisfactory reconstruction results. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight network called Coding Prior-Guided Super-Resolution (CPGSR) to address the SR challenges in compressed game video content. First, we design a Compressed Domain Guided Block (CDGB) to extract features of different depths from coding priors, which are subsequently integrated with features from the U-net backbone. Then, a series of re-parameterization blocks are utilized for reconstruction. Ultimately, inspired by the quantization in video coding, we propose a partitioned focal frequency loss to effectively guide the model's focus on preserving high-frequency information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of our approach.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Sequence Matters: Harnessing Video Models in 3D Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11525v3)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>3D super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D models from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Early studies primarily focused on single-image super-resolution (SISR) models to upsample LR images into high-resolution images. However, these methods often lack view consistency because they operate independently on each image. Although various post-processing techniques have been extensively explored to mitigate these inconsistencies, they have yet to fully resolve the issues. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of 3D super-resolution by leveraging video super-resolution (VSR) models. By utilizing VSR models, we ensure a higher degree of spatial consistency and can reference surrounding spatial information, leading to more accurate and detailed reconstructions. Our findings reveal that VSR models can perform remarkably well even on sequences that lack precise spatial alignment. Given this observation, we propose a simple yet practical approach to align LR images without involving fine-tuning or generating 'smooth' trajectory from the trained 3D models over LR images. The experimental results show that the surprisingly simple algorithms can achieve the state-of-the-art results of 3D super-resolution tasks on standard benchmark datasets, such as the NeRF-synthetic and MipNeRF-360 datasets.

They are used in various applications, such as LiDAR, and can capture high-speed sequences of binary single-photon images, offering great potential for reconstructing 3D environments with high motion dynamics. To complement single-photon data, they are often paired with conventional passive cameras, which capture high-resolution (HR) intensity images at a lower frame rate. However, 3D reconstruction from SPAD data faces challenges. Aggregating multiple binary measurements improves precision and reduces noise but can cause motion blur in dynamic scenes. Additionally, SPAD arrays often have lower resolution than passive cameras. To address these issues, we propose a novel computational imaging algorithm to improve the 3D reconstruction of moving scenes from SPAD data by addressing the motion blur and increasing the native spatial resolution. We adopt a plug-and-play approach within an optimization scheme alternating between guided video super-resolution of the 3D scene, and precise image realignment using optical flow. Experiments on synthetic data show significantly improved image resolutions across various signal-to-noise ratios and photon levels. We validate our method using real-world SPAD measurements on three practical situations with dynamic objects. First on fast-moving scenes in laboratory conditions at short range; second very low resolution imaging of people with a consumer-grade SPAD sensor from STMicroelectronics; and finally, HR imaging of people walking outdoors in daylight at a range of 325 meters under eye-safe illumination conditions using a short-wave infrared SPAD camera. These results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> |

SR has been employed in many applications including video streaming, where compressed low-resolution content is typically transmitted to end users and then reconstructed with a higher resolution and enhanced quality. To support real-time playback, it is important to implement fast SR models while preserving reconstruction quality; however most existing solutions, in particular those based on complex deep neural networks, fail to do so. To address this issue, this paper proposes a low-complexity SR method, RTSR, designed to enhance the visual quality of compressed video content, focusing on resolution up-scaling from a) 360p to 1080p and from b) 540p to 4K. The proposed approach utilizes a CNN-based network architecture, which was optimized for AV1 (SVT)-encoded content at various quantization levels based on a dual-teacher knowledge distillation method. This method was submitted to the AIM 2024 Video Super-Resolution Challenge, specifically targeting the Efficient/Mobile Real-Time Video Super-Resolution competition. It achieved the best trade-off between complexity and coding performance (measured in PSNR, SSIM and VMAF) among all six submissions. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |

However, real-time streaming of such videos, especially in live mobile scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is challenged by limited bandwidth and strict latency constraints. Traditional methods, such as compression and adaptive resolution, help but often compromise video quality and introduce artifacts that degrade the viewer experience. Additionally, the unique spherical geometry of 360-degree video presents challenges not encountered in traditional 2D video. To address these issues, we initiated the 360-degree Video Super Resolution and Quality Enhancement Challenge. This competition encourages participants to develop efficient machine learning solutions to enhance the quality of low-bitrate compressed 360-degree videos, with two tracks focusing on 2x and 4x super-resolution (SR). In this paper, we outline the challenge framework, detailing the two competition tracks and highlighting the SR solutions proposed by the top-performing models. We assess these models within a unified framework, considering quality enhancement, bitrate gain, and computational efficiency. This challenge aims to drive innovation in real-time 360-degree video streaming, improving the quality and accessibility of immersive visual experiences.</p></details> |

The traditional approach of pixel-level alignment is ineffective for diffusion-processed frames because of iterative disruptions. To overcome this, we introduce SeeClear--a novel VSR framework leveraging conditional video generation, orchestrated by instance-centric and channel-wise semantic controls. This framework integrates a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel Condenser, which synergize to extract and upscale semantic details from low-resolution frames. The Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) utilizes video-clip-wise tokens to dynamically relate pixels within and across frames, enhancing coherency. Additionally, the Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory) infuses extrinsic knowledge, capitalizing on long-standing semantic textures. Our method also innovates the blurring diffusion process with the ResShift mechanism, finely balancing between sharpness and diffusion effects. Comprehensive experiments confirm our framework's advantage over state-of-the-art diffusion-based VSR techniques.

Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin.

A common approach involves using a fixed decision tree as one player's strategy while training an RL agent as the opponent to identify vulnerabilities in the decision tree, thereby improving its strategic strength iteratively. However, this process often requires significant human intervention to refine the decision tree after identifying its weaknesses, resulting in inefficiencies and hindering full automation of the strategy enhancement process. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative opportunity to automate the process. We propose RL-LLM-DT, an automatic decision tree generation method based on RL Evaluation and LLM Enhancement. Given an initial decision tree, the method involves two important iterative steps. Response Policy Search: RL is used to discover counter-strategies targeting the decision tree. Policy Improvement: LLMs analyze failure scenarios and generate improved decision tree code. In our method, RL focuses on finding the decision tree's flaws while LLM is prompted to generate an improved version of the decision tree. The iterative refinement process terminates when RL can't find any flaw of the tree or LLM fails to improve the tree. To evaluate the effectiveness of this integrated approach, we conducted experiments in a curling game. After iterative refinements, our curling AI based on the decision tree ranks first on the Jidi platform among 34 curling AIs in total, which demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance the robustness and adaptability of decision trees, representing a substantial advancement in the field of Game AI. Our code is available at https://github.com/Linjunjie99/RL-LLM-DT.</p></details> |

However, deploying game AI in practical scenarios still poses challenges, particularly in large-scale and complex FPS games. In this paper, we focus on the practical deployment of game AI in the online multiplayer competitive 3D FPS game called Arena Breakout, developed by Tencent Games. We propose a novel gaming AI system named Private Military Company Agent (PMCA), which is interactable within a large game map and engages in combat with players while utilizing tactical advantages provided by the surrounding terrain. To address the challenges of navigation and combat in modern 3D FPS games, we introduce a method that combines navigation mesh (Navmesh) and shooting-rule with deep reinforcement learning (NSRL). The integration of Navmesh enhances the agent's global navigation capabilities while shooting behavior is controlled using rule-based methods to ensure controllability. NSRL employs a DRL model to predict when to enable the navigation mesh, resulting in a diverse range of behaviors for the game AI. Customized rewards for human-like behaviors are also employed to align PMCA's behavior with that of human players.</p></details> |

One of the major challenges is the large search space due to a diverse set of game components. In recent works, state abstraction has been applied to search-based game AI and has brought significant performance improvements. State abstraction techniques rely on reducing the search space, e.g., by aggregating similar states. However, the application of these abstractions is hindered because the quality of an abstraction is difficult to evaluate. Previous works hence abandon the abstraction in the middle of the search to not bias the search to a local optimum. This mechanism introduces a hyper-parameter to decide the time to abandon the current state abstraction. In this work, we propose a size-constrained state abstraction (SCSA), an approach that limits the maximum number of nodes being grouped together. We found that with SCSA, the abstraction is not required to be abandoned. Our empirical results on $3$ strategy games show that the SCSA agent outperforms the previous methods and yields robust performance over different games.

Learning to build decks is difficult for players and models alike due to the large card variety and highly complex semantics, as well as requiring meaningful card and deck representations when aiming to utilise AI. In addition, regular releases of new card sets lead to unforeseeable fluctuations in the available card pool, thus affecting possible deck configurations and requiring continuous updates. Previous Game AI approaches to building decks have often been limited to fixed sets of possible cards, which greatly limits their utility in practice. In this work, we explore possible card representations that generalise to unseen cards, thus greatly extending the real-world utility of AI-based deck building for the game "Magic: The Gathering".We study such representations based on numerical, nominal, and text-based features of cards, card images, and meta information about card usage from third-party services. Our results show that while the particular choice of generalised input representation has little effect on learning to predict human card selections among known cards, the performance on new, unseen cards can be greatly improved. Our generalised model is able to predict 55\% of human choices on completely unseen cards, thus showing a deep understanding of card quality and strategy.</p></details> |

In this field, Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular algorithm family, aiming to build game trees and explore them efficiently. Combinatorial Optimization, on the other hand, aims to model and solve problems with an objective to optimize and constraints to satisfy, and is less common in Game AI. We believe however that both methods can be combined efficiently, by injecting Combinatorial Optimization into Monte Carlo Tree Search to help the tree search, leading to a novel combination of these two techniques. Tested on the board game boop., our method beats 96% of the time the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm baseline. We conducted an ablation study to isolate and analyze which injections and combinations of injections lead to such performances. Finally, we opposed our AI method against human players on the Board Game Arena platform, and reached a 373 ELO rating after 51 boop. games, with a 69% win rate and finishing ranked 56th worldwide on the platform over 5,316 boop. players.</p></details> |

Reward design plays a pivotal role in training game AI models, wherein researchers implement concepts of specific reward functions. However, despite the presence of AI, the reward design process predominantly remains in the domain of human experts, as it is heavily reliant on their creativity and engineering skills. Therefore, this paper proposes ChatPCG, a large language model (LLM)-driven reward design framework.It leverages human-level insights, coupled with game expertise, to generate rewards tailored to specific game features automatically. Moreover, ChatPCG is integrated with deep reinforcement learning, demonstrating its potential for multiplayer game content generation tasks. The results suggest that the proposed LLM exhibits the capability to comprehend game mechanics and content generation tasks, enabling tailored content generation for a specified game. This study not only highlights the potential for improving accessibility in content generation but also aims to streamline the game AI development process.</p></details> |

We propose an Interactive Agent Foundation Model that uses a novel multi-task agent training paradigm for training AI agents across a wide range of domains, datasets, and tasks. Our training paradigm unifies diverse pre-training strategies, including visual masked auto-encoders, language modeling, and next-action prediction, enabling a versatile and adaptable AI framework. We demonstrate the performance of our framework across three separate domains -- Robotics, Gaming AI, and Healthcare. Our model demonstrates its ability to generate meaningful and contextually relevant outputs in each area. The strength of our approach lies in its generality, leveraging a variety of data sources such as robotics sequences, gameplay data, large-scale video datasets, and textual information for effective multimodal and multi-task learning. Our approach provides a promising avenue for developing generalist, action-taking, multimodal systems.</p></details> |

Despite this, the majority of AI agents for fighting games have only a single strategy for each "level" of difficulty. To make AI opponents more human-like, we'd ideally like to see multiple different strategies at each level of difficulty, a concept we refer to as "multidimensional" difficulty. In this paper, we introduce a diversity-based deep reinforcement learning approach for generating a set of agents of similar difficulty that utilize diverse strategies. We find this approach outperforms a baseline trained with specialized, human-authored reward functions in both diversity and performance.</p></details> |

Thus, the development of fighting game AI requires the ability to evaluate these properties. For instance, it should be possible to ensure that the characters created are believable and diverse. In this paper, we show how an automated procedure can be used to compare play styles of individual AI- and human-controlled characters, and to assess human-likeness and diversity of game participants.</p></details> |

Some other game genres can rely on their story or visuals, but fighting games are all about the adversarial experience. In this paper, we will introduce standard behavior algorithms in videogames, such as Finite-State Machines and Behavior Trees, as well as more recent developments, such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search. We will also discuss the existing and potential combinations of these algorithms, and how they might be used in fighting games. Since we are at the financial peak of fighting games, both for casual players and in tournaments, it is important to build and expand on fighting game AI, as it is one of the pillars of this growing market.</p></details> |

The challenge arises from the large action space, diverse styles of characters and abilities, and the real-time nature of the game. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines Rolling Horizon Evolution Algorithm (RHEA) with opponent model learning. The approach is readily applicable to any 2-player video game. In contrast to conventional RHEA, an opponent model is proposed and is optimized by supervised learning with cross-entropy and reinforcement learning with policy gradient and Q-learning respectively, based on history observations from opponent. The model is learned during the live gameplay. With the learned opponent model, the extended RHEA is able to make more realistic plans based on what the opponent is likely to do. This tends to lead to better results. We compared our approach directly with the bots from the FTGAIC 2018 competition, and found our method to significantly outperform all of them, for all three character. Furthermore, our proposed bot with the policy-gradient-based opponent model is the only one without using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) among top five bots in the 2019 competition in which it achieved second place, while using much less domain knowledge than the winner.</p></details> |
| **15** | **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Playing 2.5D Fighting Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02070v1)** | 2018-05-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has shown its success in game playing. However, 2.5D fighting games would be a challenging task to handle due to ambiguity in visual appearances like height or depth of the characters. Moreover, actions in such games typically involve particular sequential action orders, which also makes the network design very difficult. Based on the network of Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), we create an OpenAI-gym-like gaming environment with the game of Little Fighter 2 (LF2), and present a novel A3C+ network for learning RL agents. The introduced model includes a Recurrent Info network, which utilizes game-related info features with recurrent layers to observe combo skills for fighting. In the experiments, we consider LF2 in different settings, which successfully demonstrates the use of our proposed model for learning 2.5D fighting games.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Temperatures of Robin Hood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07239v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Cumulative Games were introduced by Larsson, Meir, and Zick (2020) to bridge some conceptual and technical gaps between Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) and Economic Game Theory. The partizan ruleset {\sc Robin Hood} is an instance of a Cumulative Game, viz., {\sc Wealth Nim}. It is played on multiple heaps, each associated with a pair of cumulations, interpreted here as wealth. Each player chooses one of the heaps, removes tokens from that heap not exceeding their own wealth, while simultaneously diminishing the other player's wealth by the same amount. In CGT, the {\em temperature} of a {\em disjunctive sum} game component is an estimate of the urgency of moving first in that component. It turns out that most of the positions of {\sc Robin Hood} are {\em hot}. The temperature of {\sc Robin Hood} on a single large heap shows a dichotomy in behavior depending on the ratio of the wealths of the players. Interestingly, this bifurcation is related to Pingala (Fibonacci) sequences and the Golden Ratio $\phi$: when the ratio of the wealths lies in the interval $(\phi^{-1},\phi)$, the temperature increases linearly with the heap size, and otherwise it remains constant, and the mean values has a reciprocal property. It turns out that despite {\sc Robin Hood} displaying high temperatures, playing in the hottest component might be a sub-optimal strategy.</p></details> |

(''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Complete Implementation of WXF Chinese Chess Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17334v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Unlike repetitions in Western Chess where all repetitions are draws, repetitions in Chinese Chess could result in a win, draw, or loss depending on the kind of repetition being made by both players. One of the biggest hurdles facing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging games correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF rules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce several novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without compromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and we saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an increased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Maker-Breaker on Galton-Watson trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08334v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider the following combinatorial two-player game: On the random tree arising from a branching process, each round one player (Breaker) deletes an edge and by that removes the descendant and all its progeny, while the other (Maker) fixates an edge to permanently secure it from deletion. Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</p></details> |

Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[The Game Value of Sequential Compounds of Integers and Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08611v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. One of the major approaches to analyzing games in combinatorial game theory is to break down a given game position into a disjunctive sum of multiple sub-positions, then evaluate the game value of each component of the sum, and finally integrate these game values to find which player has a winning strategy in the whole position. Accordingly, finding the game value of a given position is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. The sequential compound proposed by Stromquist and Ullman is a combinatorial game consisting of two combinatorial games. In the sequential compound of games $G$ and $H$, the players make moves on $G$ until $G$ is over, and then they play on $H$. In this paper, we investigate the general properties of sequential compounds. As the main result, we give the game values of sequential compounds of a finite number of integers and stars, which are basic and typical games in combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(k log n), and this time complexity is on a par with the existing O(k log n) algorithm. We do not have any recursion overhead or stack overflow because we do not use any recursion. Therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1), and ours is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm in this respect. When k is small and n is large, our algorithm is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm. This new algorithm is based on a relation between the Josephus problem and a maximum Nim of combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1\% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold. The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[An Efficient Multi-Robot Arm Coordination Strategy for Pick-and-Place Tasks using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13511v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We introduce a novel strategy for multi-robot sorting of waste objects using Reinforcement Learning. Our focus lies on finding optimal picking strategies that facilitate an effective coordination of a multi-robot system, subject to maximizing the waste removal potential. We realize this by formulating the sorting problem as an OpenAI gym environment and training a neural network with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The objective function is set up to optimize the picking rate of the robotic system. In simulation, we draw a performance comparison to an intuitive combinatorial game theory-based approach. We show that the trained policies outperform the latter and achieve up to 16% higher picking rates. Finally, the respective algorithms are validated on a hardware setup consisting of a two-robot sorting station able to process incoming waste objects through pick-and-place operations.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[XQSV: A Structurally Variable Network to Imitate Human Play in Xiangqi](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04678v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an innovative deep learning architecture, termed Xiangqi Structurally Variable (XQSV), designed to emulate the behavioral patterns of human players in Xiangqi, or Chinese Chess. The unique attribute of XQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically, optimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on which it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to significantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local illegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional input, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations reveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its performance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's success in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific range. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV model imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi engines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the inherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic Xiangqi players.</p></details> |

In combinatorial game theory, the temperature of a position is a measure of the urgency of moving first. It is known that the temperature of \snort in general is infinite ($K_{1,n}$ has temperature $n$). We show that the temperature in addition can be infinitely larger than the degree of the board being played on. We do so by constructing a family of positions in which the temperature grows twice as fast as the degree of the board.</p></details> |

To resolve this fundamental question, we consider superstars, positions first introduced in Winning Ways where all options are nimbers. Extending Morris' classic result with hot games to tepid games, we prove that disjunctive sums of superstars are intractable to solve. This is striking as sums of nimbers can be computed in linear time. Our analyses also lead to a family of elegant board games with intriguing complexity, for which we present web-playable versions of the rulesets described within.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[Shogi and Frieze group](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08591v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Shogi is a traditional Japanese strategy board game in the same family as chess, chaturanga, and xiangqi, and has been theoretically studied from various aspects. The research on recommended sequences of moves in each opening of shogi is called joseki; how to use a rook (Static Rook and Ranging Rook), or how to develop a castle, etc. Also, many pieces of tsume shogi, artistic shogi miniature problems, in which the opponent's king is checkmated by a series of checks, have been created involving various beautiful techniques such as "saw" and "puzzle ring". In addition, the rapid development of AI in recent years has led to the pursuit of the best possible moves in shogi. In this paper, we move away from the study of winning and losing in shogi and focus on the mathematical aspects of the movement of shogi pieces. We propose to correspond movements of shogi pieces to a set of geometrical patterns constructed by the shape of shogi pieces and representing the Frieze group through the condition regarding the neighborhood of arrangements of given shogi pieces. Although the discovery of this correspondence does not lead to a winning strategy for shogi, however, it does demonstrate a curious involvement between the traditional Japanese board game and Western mathematics.</p></details> |

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

"JieQi"), a variation of Chinese chess. Dark Chinese chess combines some of the most complicated aspects of board and card games, such as long-term strategy or planning, large state space, stochastic, and imperfect-information, which make it closer to the real world decision-making problem and pose great challenges to game AI.

Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT. Experiments show that with the same features and the same Chinese chess program, the automatically tuned comparison training feature weights achieved a win rate of 86.58% against the weights that were hand-tuned.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[ChartCoder: Advancing Multimodal Large Language Model for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06598v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks.: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability. Our code will be available at https://github.com/thunlp/ChartCoder.</p></details> |

However, Code LLMs often fail to capture existing coding standards, leading to the generation of code that conflicts with the required design patterns for a given project. As a result, developers must post-process to adapt the generated code to the project's design norms. In this work, we empirically investigate the biases of Code LLMs in software development. Through carefully designed experiments, we assess the models' understanding of design patterns across recognition, comprehension, and generation. Our findings reveal that biases in Code LLMs significantly affect the reliability of downstream tasks.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[EpiCoder: Encompassing Diversity and Complexity in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04694v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Effective instruction tuning is indispensable for optimizing code LLMs, aligning model behavior with user expectations and enhancing model performance in real-world applications. However, most existing methods focus on code snippets, which are limited to specific functionalities and rigid structures, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework inspired by Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). Unlike AST, which captures syntactic structure of code, our framework models semantic relationships between code elements, enabling the generation of more nuanced and diverse data. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features. This process enables the identification of more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By sampling subtrees with controlled depth and breadth, our framework allows precise adjustments to the complexity of the generated code, supporting a wide range of tasks from simple function-level operations to intricate multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to create the EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance at both the function and file levels across multiple benchmarks. Notably, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in synthesizing highly complex repository-level code data. Further analysis elucidates the merits of this approach by rigorously assessing data complexity and diversity through software engineering principles and LLM-as-a-judge method.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04510v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose. However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters. Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases. However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code. Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions. This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning. It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions. The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma. Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p></details> |

Benchmark and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18573v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.</p></details> |

The HumanEval Benchmark, developed by OpenAI, remains the most widely used code generation benchmark. However, this and other Code LLM benchmarks face critical limitations, particularly in task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope. Current evaluations primarily focus on English-to-Python conversion tasks with limited test cases, potentially overestimating model performance. While recent works have addressed test coverage and programming language (PL) diversity, code generation from low-resource language prompts remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce mHumanEval, an extended benchmark supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. We employ established machine translation methods to compile the benchmark, coupled with a quality assurance process. Furthermore, we provide expert human translations for 15 diverse natural languages (NLs). We conclude by analyzing the multilingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Code LLMs, offering insights into the current landscape of cross-lingual code generation.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v4)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate the desired complete functional code based on incomplete code snippets and natural language prompts. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. However, both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. This paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an ASR of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an ASR of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token perturbation. Our work alerts a new practical threat of using Code LLMs.</p></details> |

But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</p></details> |

BERT-based Speech pre-Training with Random-projection Quantizer (BEST-RQ) has achieved state-of-the-art results in speech recognition. In this work, we further optimize the BEST-RQ approach using Kullback-Leibler divergence as an additional regularizing loss and multi-codebook extension per cluster derived from low-level feature clustering. Preliminary experiments on train-100 split of LibriSpeech result in a relative improvement of 11.2% on test-clean by using multiple codebooks, utilizing a combination of cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence further reduces the word error rate by 4.5%. The proposed optimizations on full LibriSpeech pre-training and fine-tuning result in relative word error rate improvements of up to 23.8% on test-clean and 30.6% on test-other using 6 codebooks. Furthermore, the proposed setup leads to faster convergence in pre-training and fine-tuning and additionally stabilizes the pre-training.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Classification Error Bound for Low Bayes Error Conditions in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15977v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In statistical classification and machine learning, classification error is an important performance measure, which is minimized by the Bayes decision rule. In practice, the unknown true distribution is usually replaced with a model distribution estimated from the training data in the Bayes decision rule. This substitution introduces a mismatch between the Bayes error and the model-based classification error. In this work, we apply classification error bounds to study the relationship between the error mismatch and the Kullback-Leibler divergence in machine learning. Motivated by recent observations of low model-based classification errors in many machine learning tasks, bounding the Bayes error to be lower, we propose a linear approximation of the classification error bound for low Bayes error conditions. Then, the bound for class priors are discussed. Moreover, we extend the classification error bound for sequences. Using automatic speech recognition as a representative example of machine learning applications, this work analytically discusses the correlations among different performance measures with extended bounds, including cross-entropy loss, language model perplexity, and word error rate.</p></details> |

This paper proposes a robust Target-Speaker Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (TS-RNNT) with dual attention mechanisms for contextual biasing and overlapping enrollment processing. The model incorporates a text decoder and attention mechanism specifically designed to extract relevant speaker characteristics from noisy, overlapping enrollment audio. Experimental results on a synthesized dataset demonstrate the model's resilience, maintaining a Word Error Rate (WER) of 16.44% even with overlapping enrollment at 5dB Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR), compared to conventional approaches that degrade to WERs above 75% under similar conditions. This significant performance improvement, coupled with the model's semi-text-dependent enrollment capabilities, represents a substantial advancement toward more practical and versatile voice-controlled devices.</p></details> |

However, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) errors in critical medical terms remain a significant challenge. These errors can compromise patient care and safety if not detected. This study investigates the prevalence and impact of ASR errors in medical transcription in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. By evaluating raw and LLM-corrected transcriptions of accented English in these regions, we assess the potential and limitations of LLMs to address challenges related to accents and medical terminology in ASR. Our findings highlight significant disparities in ASR accuracy across regions and identify specific conditions under which LLM corrections are most effective.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Speech Translation Refinement using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15090v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities across various language tasks. Inspired by the success of text-to-text translation refinement, this paper investigates how LLMs can improve the performance of speech translation by introducing a joint refinement process. Through the joint refinement of speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcription via LLMs, the performance of the ST model is significantly improved in both training-free in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effect of document-level context on refinement under the context-aware fine-tuning scenario. Experimental results on the MuST-C and CoVoST 2 datasets, which include seven translation tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several popular LLMs including GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-12B. Further analysis further suggests that jointly refining both transcription and translation yields better performance compared to refining translation alone. Meanwhile, incorporating document-level context significantly enhances refinement performance. We release our code and datasets on GitHub.</p></details> |

Despite the growing body of research in dysarthric speech recognition, many existing systems are speaker-dependent and adaptive, limiting their generalizability across different speakers and etiologies. Our primary objective is to develop a robust speaker-independent model capable of accurately recognizing dysarthric speech, irrespective of the speaker. Additionally, as a secondary objective, we aim to test the cross-etiology performance of our model by evaluating it on the TORGO dataset, which contains speech samples from individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By leveraging the Whisper model, our speaker-independent system achieved a CER of 6.99% and a WER of 10.71% on the SAP-1005 dataset. Further, in cross-etiology settings, we achieved a CER of 25.08% and a WER of 39.56% on the TORGO dataset. These results highlight the potential of our approach to generalize across unseen speakers and different etiologies of dysarthria.</p></details> |

FireRedASR comprises two variants: FireRedASR-LLM: Designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and to enable seamless end-to-end speech interaction. It adopts an Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-LLM (8.3B parameters) achieves an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.05%, surpassing the latest SOTA of 3.33% with an 8.4% relative CER reduction (CERR). It demonstrates superior generalization capability over industrial-grade baselines, achieving 24%-40% CERR in multi-source Mandarin ASR scenarios such as video, live, and intelligent assistant. FireRedASR-AED: Designed to balance high performance and computational efficiency and to serve as an effective speech representation module in LLM-based speech models. It utilizes an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) architecture. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-AED (1.1B parameters) achieves an average CER of 3.18%, slightly worse than FireRedASR-LLM but still outperforming the latest SOTA model with over 12B parameters. It offers a more compact size, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Moreover, both models exhibit competitive results on Chinese dialects and English speech benchmarks and excel in singing lyrics recognition. To advance research in speech processing, we release our models and inference code at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRedASR.</p></details> |

Traditional solutions often struggle to manage the complexities of connecting heterogeneous models, especially when dealing with varied technical specifications. These limitations are amplified in large-scale, collaborative projects where stakeholders contribute models with different technical specifications. To address these challenges, we developed LoCoML, a low-code framework designed to simplify the integration of diverse ML models within the context of the \textit{Bhashini Project} - a large-scale initiative aimed at integrating AI-driven language technologies such as automatic speech recognition, machine translation, text-to-speech, and optical character recognition to support seamless communication across more than 20 languages. Initial evaluations show that LoCoML adds only a small amount of computational load, making it efficient and effective for large-scale ML integration. Our practical insights show that a low-code approach can be a practical solution for connecting multiple ML models in a collaborative environment.</p></details> |

While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.</p></details> |

To improve readability, we propose a Contextualized Spoken-to-Written conversion (CoS2W) task to address ASR and grammar errors and also transfer the informal text into the formal style with content preserved, utilizing contexts and auxiliary information. This task naturally matches the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate comprehensive comparisons of various LLMs, we construct a document-level Spoken-to-Written conversion of ASR Transcripts Benchmark (SWAB) dataset. Using SWAB, we study the impact of different granularity levels on the CoS2W performance, and propose methods to exploit contexts and auxiliary information to enhance the outputs. Experimental results reveal that LLMs have the potential to excel in the CoS2W task, particularly in grammaticality and formality, our methods achieve effective understanding of contexts and auxiliary information by LLMs. We further investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators and find that LLM evaluators show strong correlations with human evaluations on rankings of faithfulness and formality, which validates the reliability of LLM evaluators for the CoS2W task.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano. Code and models are available at https://github.com/vefalun/NanoHTNet.</p></details> |

However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |

Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |

Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint. This work pioneers a data-driven, feed-forward SfM approach, paving the way toward scalable, accurate, and efficient 3D reconstruction in the wild.</p></details> |

Previous works predominantly focused on either estimating poses(often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but not both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly trained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key design choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D shape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we augment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with transformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D interaction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D shape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize the information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to train the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two encoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent features to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder of the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by codeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus on pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict the object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the code optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies and comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |

| **10** | **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the fine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks. Fine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action Models(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection costs and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's high-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our key insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional affordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe interaction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as a bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial constraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary robotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive resampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level execution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, highlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale simulation data generation.</p></details> |

Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands.

Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance, achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and rotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

| **14** | **[GSGTrack: Gaussian Splatting-Guided Object Pose Tracking from RGB Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02267v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Tracking the 6DoF pose of unknown objects in monocular RGB video sequences is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches typically rely on accurate depth information, which is non-trivial to obtain in real-world scenarios. Although depth estimation algorithms can be employed, geometric inaccuracy can lead to failures in RGBD-based pose tracking methods. To address this challenge, we introduce GSGTrack, a novel RGB-based pose tracking framework that jointly optimizes geometry and pose. Specifically, we adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting to create an optimizable 3D representation, which is learned simultaneously with a graph-based geometry optimization to capture the object's appearance features and refine its geometry. However, the joint optimization process is susceptible to perturbations from noisy pose and geometry data. Thus, we propose an object silhouette loss to address the issue of pixel-wise loss being overly sensitive to pose noise during tracking. To mitigate the geometric ambiguities caused by inaccurate depth information, we propose a geometry-consistent image pair selection strategy, which filters out low-confidence pairs and ensures robust geometric optimization. Extensive experiments on the OnePose and HO3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSGTrack in both 6DoF pose tracking and object reconstruction.</p></details> |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |
| **16** | **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.</p></details> |

The system leverages multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

In this letter, we address the problem of robust localization in cluttered indoor environments like office spaces and corridors using 3D LiDAR point clouds in a given Area Graph, which is a hierarchical, topometric semantic map representation that uses polygons to demark areas such as rooms, corridors or buildings. This representation is very compact, can represent different floors of buildings through its hierarchy and provides semantic information that helps with localization, like poses of doors and glass. In contrast to this, commonly used map representations, such as occupancy grid maps or point clouds, lack these features and require frequent updates in response to environmental changes (e.g. moved furniture), unlike our approach, which matches against lifelong architectural features such as walls and doors. For that we apply filtering to remove clutter from the 3D input point cloud and then employ further scoring and weight functions for localization. Given a broad initial guess from WiFi localization, our experiments show that our global localization and the weighted point to line ICP pose tracking perform very well, even when compared to localization and SLAM algorithms that use the current, feature-rich cluttered map for localization.</p></details> |

To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.</p></details> |

Building on the performance of the WINCLIP framework, we aim to enhance the system's localization capabilities by integrating zero-shot segmentation models. In addition, we perform foreground instance segmentation which enables the model to focus on the relevant parts of the image, thus allowing the models to better identify small or subtle deviations. Our pipeline requires no external data or information, allowing for it to be directly applied to new datasets.

For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.</p></details> |
| **24** | **[Unifying Tracking and Image-Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11077v2)** | 2022-11-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Objection detection (OD) has been one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.</p></details> |

Specifically, we formulate the challenge to adapt an average TTS model to the stylistic target voice with limited data from target speaker, evaluated by speaker identity and style similarity. The challenge consists of two tracks, namely few-shot track and one-shot track, where the participants are required to clone multiple target voices with 100 and 5 samples respectively.

However, its maximum-likelihood-seeking behavior often leads to degraded visual quality and diversity, limiting its effectiveness in 3D applications. In this work, we propose Consistent Flow Distillation (CFD), which addresses these limitations. We begin by leveraging the gradient of the diffusion ODE or SDE sampling process to guide the 3D generation. From the gradient-based sampling perspective, we find that the consistency of 2D image flows across different viewpoints is important for high-quality 3D generation. To achieve this, we introduce multi-view consistent Gaussian noise on the 3D object, which can be rendered from various viewpoints to compute the flow gradient. Our experiments demonstrate that CFD, through consistent flows, significantly outperforms previous methods in text-to-3D generation.</p></details> |

However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.</p></details> |

However, the textual description of 3D scenes is inherently inaccurate and lacks fine-grained control during training, leading to implausible scene generation. As an intuitive and feasible solution, the 3D layout allows for precise specification of object locations within the scene. To this end, we present a text-to-scene generation method (namely, Layout2Scene) using additional semantic layout as the prompt to inject precise control of 3D object positions. Specifically, we first introduce a scene hybrid representation to decouple objects and backgrounds, which is initialized via a pre-trained text-to-3D model. Then, we propose a two-stage scheme to optimize the geometry and appearance of the initialized scene separately. To fully leverage 2D diffusion priors in geometry and appearance generation, we introduce a semantic-guided geometry diffusion model and a semantic-geometry guided diffusion model which are finetuned on a scene dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate more plausible and realistic scenes as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the generated scene allows for flexible yet precise editing, thereby facilitating multiple downstream applications.</p></details> |

In this work, we show that existing feed-forward reconstruction methods can serve as effective latent encoders for training 3D generative models, thereby bridging these two paradigms. By reusing powerful pre-trained reconstruction models, we avoid computationally expensive encoder network training and obtain rich 3D latent features for generative modeling for free. However, the latent spaces of reconstruction models are not well-suited for generative modeling due to their unstructured nature. To enable flow-based model training on these latent features, we develop post-processing pipelines, including protocols to standardize the features and spatial weighting to concentrate on important regions. We further incorporate a 2D image space perceptual rendering loss to handle the high-dimensional latent spaces. Finally, we propose a multi-stream transformer-based rectified flow architecture to achieve linear scaling and high-quality text-conditioned 3D generation. Our framework leverages the advancements of feed-forward reconstruction models to enhance the scalability of 3D generative modeling, achieving both high computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-3D generation.</p></details> |

To ensure generalizability, we build our model upon pre-trained text-to-image generation model with only minimal adjustments, and further train it using a large number of images from both single-view and multi-view datasets. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-D latent space into 3D Gaussian generation to disentangle appearance and geometry information, enabling efficient feed-forward generation of 3D Gaussians with better fidelity and geometry.

However, generating complex 3D scenes remains an open challenge due to the intricate relations between objects. Moreover, existing methods are largely based on score distillation sampling (SDS), which constrains the ability to manipulate multiobjects with specific interactions. Addressing these critical yet underexplored issues, we present a novel framework of Scene Graph and Layout Guided 3D Scene Generation (GraLa3D). Given a text prompt describing a complex 3D scene, GraLa3D utilizes LLM to model the scene using a scene graph representation with layout bounding box information. GraLa3D uniquely constructs the scene graph with single-object nodes and composite super-nodes. In addition to constraining 3D generation within the desirable layout, a major contribution lies in the modeling of interactions between objects in a super-node, while alleviating appearance leakage across objects within such nodes. Our experiments confirm that GraLa3D overcomes the above limitations and generates complex 3D scenes closely aligned with text prompts.</p></details> |

These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin. We also showcase downstream applications such as 3D part editing.</p></details> |

Our pipeline begins by employing a multi-view latent diffusion model that generates consistent side and back views of the head from a single facial input. These generated views then serve as input to a GS-LRM reconstructor, which produces a comprehensive 3D representation using Gaussian splats. To train our system, we develop a dataset of multi-view renderings using synthetic 3D human head as-sets. The diffusion-based multi-view generator is trained exclusively on synthetic head images, while the GS-LRM reconstructor undergoes initial training on Objaverse followed by fine-tuning on synthetic head data. FaceLift excels at preserving identity and maintaining view consistency across views. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, FaceLift demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D head reconstruction, highlighting its practical applicability and robust performance on real-world images. In addition to single image reconstruction, FaceLift supports video inputs for 4D novel view synthesis and seamlessly integrates with 2D reanimation techniques to enable 3D facial animation.

The core insight of this work is to migrate the multimodal unification and promising learning capabilities of the next-token prediction paradigm to conditional 3D object generation. To achieve this, the 3D VQ-VAE first encodes a wide range of 3D shapes into a compact triplane latent space and utilizes a set of discrete representations from a trainable codebook to reconstruct fine-grained geometries under the supervision of query point occupancy. Then, the 3D GPT, equipped with a custom triplane position embedding called TriPE, predicts the codebook index sequence with prefilling prompt tokens in an autoregressive manner so that the composition of 3D geometries can be modeled part by part. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and Objaverse demonstrate that TAR3D can achieve superior generation quality over existing methods in text-to-3D and image-to-3D tasks</p></details> |
| **11** | **[3D Shape Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15618v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We introduce Shape Tokens, a 3D representation that is continuous, compact, and easy to incorporate into machine learning models. Shape Tokens act as conditioning vectors that represent shape information in a 3D flow-matching model. The flow-matching model is trained to approximate probability density functions corresponding to delta functions concentrated on the surfaces of shapes in 3D. By attaching Shape Tokens to various machine learning models, we can generate new shapes, convert images to 3D, align 3D shapes with text and images, and render shapes directly at variable, user specified, resolution. Moreover, Shape Tokens enable a systematic analysis of geometric properties such as normal, density, and deformation field. Across all tasks and experiments, utilizing Shape Tokens demonstrate strong performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D 1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D 1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p></details> |

Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a robust text-to-texture method for generating consistent and seamless textures that are well aligned with the mesh. Our method leverages state-of-the-art 2D diffusion models, including SDXL and multiple ControlNets, to capture structural features and intricate details in the generated textures. The method also employs a symmetrical view synthesis strategy combined with regional prompts for enhancing view consistency. Additionally, it introduces novel texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques, which significantly reduce the seam regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

However, applying these models to synthesize textures for 3D geometries remains challenging due to the domain gap between 2D images and textures on a 3D surface. Early works that used a projecting-and-inpainting approach managed to preserve generation diversity but often resulted in noticeable artifacts and style inconsistencies. While recent methods have attempted to address these inconsistencies, they often introduce other issues, such as blurring, over-saturation, or over-smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel text-to-texture synthesis framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models. We first introduce a local attention reweighing mechanism in the self-attention layers to guide the model in concentrating on spatial-correlated patches across different views, thereby enhancing local details while preserving cross-view consistency. Additionally, we propose a novel latent space merge pipeline, which further ensures consistency across different viewpoints without sacrificing too much diversity. Our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques regarding texture consistency and visual quality, while delivering results much faster than distillation-based methods. Importantly, our framework does not require additional training or fine-tuning, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of models available on public platforms.</p></details> |

However, the diffusion models used in these techniques are prone to viewpoint bias and thus lead to geometric inconsistencies such as the Janus problem. To counter this, we introduce MT3D, a text-to-3D generative model that leverages a high-fidelity 3D object to overcome viewpoint bias and explicitly infuse geometric understanding into the generation pipeline. Firstly, we employ depth maps derived from a high-quality 3D model as control signals to guarantee that the generated 2D images preserve the fundamental shape and structure, thereby reducing the inherent viewpoint bias. Next, we utilize deep geometric moments to ensure geometric consistency in the 3D representation explicitly. By incorporating geometric details from a 3D asset, MT3D enables the creation of diverse and geometrically consistent objects, thereby improving the quality and usability of our 3D representations.

However, the SDS method always generates 3D objects with poor quality due to the over-smooth issue. This issue is attributed to two factors: 1) the DDPM single-step inference produces poor guidance gradients; 2) the randomness from the input noises and timesteps averages the details of the 3D contents. In this paper, to address the issue, we propose DreamLCM which incorporates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM). DreamLCM leverages the powerful image generation capabilities inherent in LCM, enabling generating consistent and high-quality guidance, i.e., predicted noises or images. Powered by the improved guidance, the proposed method can provide accurate and detailed gradients to optimize the target 3D models. In addition, we propose two strategies to enhance the generation quality further. Firstly, we propose a guidance calibration strategy, utilizing Euler Solver to calibrate the guidance distribution to accelerate 3D models to converge. Secondly, we propose a dual timestep strategy, increasing the consistency of guidance and optimizing 3D models from geometry to appearance in DreamLCM. Experiments show that DreamLCM achieves state-of-the-art results in both generation quality and training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/1YimingZhong/DreamLCM.</p></details> |

It supports physically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in real-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of previously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual inputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D AssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and text-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen represents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in volumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two techniques achieves a win rate of 68% with respect to the single-stage model. We compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms them in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual prompts, while being significantly faster.</p></details> |

Our method leverages a tandem neural approach, consisting of two modules, to accurately model the distribution of spatially varying reflectance as described by text prompts. Initially, we employ a pre-trained stable diffusion 2 model to generate a latent representation that informs the overall shape of the material and serves as our backbone model. Then, our ReflectanceUNet enables fine-tuning control over the material's physical appearance and generates SVBRDF maps. ReflectanceUNet module is trained on an extensive dataset comprising approximately 200,000 synthetic spatially varying materials. Our generative SVBRDF diffusion model allows for the synthesis of multiple SVBRDF estimates from a single textual input, offering users the possibility to choose the output that best aligns with their requirements. We illustrate our method's versatility by generating SVBRDF maps from a range of textual descriptions, both specific and broad. Our ReflectanceUNet model can integrate optional physical parameters, such as roughness and specularity, enhancing customization. When the backbone module is fixed, the ReflectanceUNet module refines the material, allowing direct edits to its physical attributes. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that ReflectanceFusion achieves better accuracy than existing text-to-material models, such as Text2Mat, while also providing the benefits of editable and relightable SVBRDF maps.</p></details> |

Different from previous large reconstruction models (LRMs) that focus on NeRF-based reconstruction, MeshLRM incorporates differentiable mesh extraction and rendering within the LRM framework. This allows for end-to-end mesh reconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering. Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complex designs in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trained with low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enables significantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with less compute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction from sparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, including text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation.

Existing methods primarily adopt a combination of pretrained depth-aware diffusion and inpainting models, yet they exhibit shortcomings such as 3D inconsistency and limited controllability. To address these challenges, we introduce InteX, a novel framework for interactive text-to-texture synthesis. 1) InteX includes a user-friendly interface that facilitates interaction and control throughout the synthesis process, enabling region-specific repainting and precise texture editing. 2) Additionally, we develop a unified depth-aware inpainting model that integrates depth information with inpainting cues, effectively mitigating 3D inconsistencies and improving generation speed.

However, current progress often neglects the intricate high-order correlation of geometry and texture within 3D objects, leading to challenges such as over-smoothness, over-saturation and the Janus problem. In this work, we propose a method named ``3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph (Hyper-3DG)'', designed to capture the sophisticated high-order correlations present within 3D objects. Our framework is anchored by a well-established mainflow and an essential module, named ``Geometry and Texture Hypergraph Refiner (HGRefiner)''. This module not only refines the representation of 3D Gaussians but also accelerates the update process of these 3D Gaussians by conducting the Patch-3DGS Hypergraph Learning on both explicit attributes and latent visual features. Our framework allows for the production of finely generated 3D objects within a cohesive optimization, effectively circumventing degradation. Extensive experimentation has shown that our proposed method significantly enhances the quality of 3D generation while incurring no additional computational overhead for the underlying framework.

We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</p></details> |

Paint-it synthesizes texture maps from a text description by synthesis-through-optimization, exploiting the Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS). We observe that directly applying SDS yields undesirable texture quality due to its noisy gradients. We reveal the importance of texture parameterization when using SDS. Specifically, we propose Deep Convolutional Physically-Based Rendering (DC-PBR) parameterization, which re-parameterizes the physically-based rendering (PBR) texture maps with randomly initialized convolution-based neural kernels, instead of a standard pixel-based parameterization. We show that DC-PBR inherently schedules the optimization curriculum according to texture frequency and naturally filters out the noisy signals from SDS. In experiments, Paint-it obtains remarkable quality PBR texture maps within 15 min., given only a text description. We demonstrate the generalizability and practicality of Paint-it by synthesizing high-quality texture maps for large-scale mesh datasets and showing test-time applications such as relighting and material control using a popular graphics engine.

In this regard, we propose a novel pipeline called Deep Fusion MVR (DF-MVR) to explore the feature correspondences between multi-view images and reconstruct high-precision 3D faces. Specifically, we present a novel multi-view feature fusion backbone that utilizes face masks to align features from multiple encoders and integrates one multi-layer attention mechanism to enhance feature interaction and fusion, resulting in one unified facial representation. Additionally, we develop one concise face mask mechanism that facilitates multi-view feature fusion and facial reconstruction by identifying common areas and guiding the network's focus on critical facial features (e.g., eyes, brows, nose, and mouth). Experiments on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus datasets indicate the superiority of our model. Without 3D annotation, DF-MVR achieves 5.2% and 3.0% RMSE improvement over the existing weakly supervised MVRs respectively on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus dataset.

A Survey on mining LTL Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16274v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Virtually all verification techniques using formal methods rely on the availability of a formal specification, which describes the design requirements precisely. However, formulating specifications remains a manual task that is notoriously challenging and error-prone. To address this bottleneck in formal verification, recent research has thus focussed on automatically generating specifications for formal verification from examples of (desired and undesired) system behavior. In this survey, we list and compare recent advances in mining specifications in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), the de facto standard specification language for reactive systems. Several approaches have been designed for learning LTL formulas, which address different aspects and settings of specification design. Moreover, the approaches rely on a diverse range of techniques such as constraint solving, neural network training, enumerative search, etc. We survey the current state-of-the-art techniques and compare them for the convenience of the formal methods practitioners.</p></details> |

These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress. However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o. They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps. Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities. We hope our findings inspire further research. Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies</p></details> |

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |

Our formulation is general and solves a wide range of problems, including verifying properties of probabilistic programs that use machine learning, and subgroup analysis in healthcare modeling. We show that for a broad class of machine learning models, including linear models, tree-based models, and neural networks, verifying properties of Markov chains like reachability, hitting time, and total reward can be formulated as a bilinear program. We develop a decomposition and bound propagation scheme for solving the bilinear program and show through computational experiments that our method solves the problem to global optimality up to 100x faster than state-of-the-art solvers. We also release $\texttt{markovml}$, an open-source tool for building Markov processes, integrating pretrained machine learning models, and verifying their properties, available at https://github.com/mmaaz-git/markovml.</p></details> |

Skolemization removes strong quantifiers by introducing new function symbols, enabling efficient proof search algorithms. We characterize intermediate first-order logics that admit standard (and Andrews) Skolemization. These are the logics that allow classical quantifier shift principles. For some logics not in this category, innovative forms of Skolem functions are developed that allow Skolemization. Moreover, we analyze predicate intuitionistic logic with quantifier shift axioms and demonstrate its Kripke frame-incompleteness. These findings may foster resolution-based theorem provers for non-classical logics. This article is part of a larger project investigating Skolemization in non-classical logics.</p></details> |

These challenges make it difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional image data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically treated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{SEVIN} (Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a framework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode high-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By annotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate convex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification, significantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability. Integrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for formal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our approach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world perturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture environmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves efficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into controller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques and practical applications in safety-critical systems.</p></details> |

Formal language tools provide a robust and sound method to verify safety rules for such complex cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of formal verification languages like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to generate safe trajectories and optimal control inputs for autonomous vehicle navigation. We implement a symbolic path planning approach using LTL to generate a formally safe reference trajectory. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver is then used on this reference trajectory to solve for the control inputs while satisfying the state, control and safety constraints described by STL. We test our proposed solution on two environments and compare the results with popular path planning algorithms. In contrast to conventional path planning algorithms, our formally safe solution excels in handling complex specification scenarios while ensuring both safety and comparable computation times.</p></details> |

To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.</p></details> |

To alleviate the data sparsity issue, we design a scalable framework to iterative synthesize data with low cost. Besides, guided tree search algorithms are designed to enable effective ``system 2 thinking`` of the prover. HunyuanProver achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on major benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves a pass of 68.4% on the miniF2F-test compared to 65.9%, the current SOTA results. It proves 4 IMO statements (imo_1960_p2, imo_1962_p2}, imo_1964_p2 and imo_1983_p6) in miniF2F-test. To benefit the community, we will open-source a dataset of 30k synthesized instances, where each instance contains the original question in natural language, the converted statement by autoformalization, and the proof by HunyuanProver.</p></details> |

However, the verification process requires significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs. Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). This work has shown that identifying relevant premises, such as lemmas and definitions, can aid synthesis. We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that automatically identifies relevant premises and also similar proofs from the current project and uses them during synthesis. Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM. In this way, Rango adapts to the project and to the evolving state of the proof. We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,226 open-source Coq projects and 196,929 theorems from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes proofs for 32.0% of the theorems, which is 29% more theorems than the prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician. Our evaluation also shows that Rango adding relevant proofs to its context leads to a 47% increase in the number of theorems proven.</p></details> |

We present WithdrarXiv, the first large-scale dataset of withdrawn papers from arXiv, containing over 14,000 papers and their associated retraction comments spanning the repository's entire history through September 2024. Through careful analysis of author comments, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of retraction reasons, identifying 10 distinct categories ranging from critical errors to policy violations. We demonstrate a simple yet highly accurate zero-shot automatic categorization of retraction reasons, achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.96. Additionally, we release WithdrarXiv-SciFy, an enriched version including scripts for parsed full-text PDFs, specifically designed to enable research in scientific feasibility studies, claim verification, and automated theorem proving. These findings provide valuable insights for improving scientific quality control and automated verification systems.

Deriving the most appropriate subsequent proof step, and reasoning about it, given the multitude of possibilities, remains a daunting task for novice users. To improve the situation, several investigations have developed machine learning based guidance for tactic selection. Such approaches struggle to learn non-trivial relationships between the chosen tactic and the structure of the proof state and represent them as symbolic expressions. To address these issues we (i) We represent the problem as an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) task, (ii) Using the ILP representation we enriched the feature space by encoding additional, computationally expensive properties as background knowledge predicates, (iii) We use this enriched feature space to learn rules explaining when a tactic is applicable to a given proof state, (iv) we use the learned rules to filter the output of an existing tactic selection approach and empirically show improvement over the non-filtering approaches.</p></details> |

The major learning paradigm is expert iteration, which necessitates a pre-defined dataset comprising numerous mathematical problems. In this process, LLMs attempt to prove problems within the dataset and iteratively refine their capabilities through self-training on the proofs they discover. We propose to use large scale LEAN problem datasets Lean-workbook for expert iteration with more than 20,000 CPU days. During expert iteration, we found log-linear trends between solved problem amount with proof length and CPU usage. We train a critic model to select relatively easy problems for policy models to make trials and guide the model to search for deeper proofs. InternLM2.5-StepProver achieves open-source state-of-the-art on MiniF2F, Lean-Workbook-Plus, ProofNet, and Putnam benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves a pass of 65.9% on the MiniF2F-test and proves (or disproves) 17.0% of problems in Lean-Workbook-Plus which shows a significant improvement compared to only 9.5% of problems proved when Lean-Workbook-Plus was released. We open-source our models and searched proofs at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook.</p></details> |

In practice, it is mainly used for interactive theorem proving with intensional type theories, with PVS being a notable exception. In this paper, we present native rules for automated reasoning in a dependently-typed version (DHOL) of classical higher-order logic (HOL). DHOL has an extensional type theory with an undecidable type checking problem which contains theorem proving. We implemented the inference rules as well as an automatic type checking mode in Lash, a fork of Satallax, the leading tableaux-based prover for HOL. Our method is sound and complete with respect to provability in DHOL. Completeness is guaranteed by the incorporation of a sound and complete translation from DHOL to HOL recently proposed by Rothgang et al. While this translation can already be used as a preprocessing step to any HOL prover, to achieve better performance, our system directly works in DHOL. Moreover, experimental results show that the DHOL version of Lash can outperform all major HOL provers executed on the translation.</p></details> |

This approach is appropriate for systems with stationary nodes but cannot be applied to systems with moving nodes. In this paper, we use celestial mechanics to model spacecraft movement, and timed automata (TA) to formalize and verify the centralized FL orchestration protocol, in two phases. In the first phase, we created a conventional TA model to prove traditional properties, namely deadlock freeness and termination. In the second phase, we created a stochastic TA model to prove timing correctness and to estimate termination probability.</p></details> |

Examples of such axioms include quasilinearity, homotheticity, independence-type axioms for mixture spaces, constant relative/absolute risk and ambiguity aversion axioms, stationarity for dated rewards or consumption streams, separability, and many others. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for invariant rationalizability via a novel approach which relies on tools from the theoretical computer science literature on automated theorem proving. We also establish a generalization of the Dushnik-Miller theorem, which we use to give a complete description of the out-of-sample predictions generated by the data under any such collection of axioms.</p></details> |

We first present an updated version of a traditional argument that limitative results from computability and complexity theory show that proof discovery is an inherently difficult problem. We then illustrate how several recent applications of artificial intelligence-inspired methods -- respectively involving automated theorem proving, SAT-solvers, and large language models -- do indeed raise novel questions about the nature of mathematical proof. We also argue that the results obtained by such techniques do not tell against our basic argument. This is so because they are embodiments of brute force search and are thus capable of deciding only statements of low logical complexity.</p></details> |

The same proof assistants can be used to verify the correctness of code by pairing code with specifications and proofs that the specifications hold. Automating the writing of code, specifications, and proofs could lower the cost of verification, or, ambitiously, enable an AI agent to output safe, provably correct code. However, it remains unclear whether current neural theorem provers can automatically verify even relatively simple programs. We present miniCodeProps, a benchmark of 201 program specifications in the Lean proof assistant, aimed at the subproblem of automatically generating a proof for a provided program and specification. miniCodeProps contains specifications about simple, self-contained programs (e.g., lists, natural numbers, binary trees) with varied proof difficulty. Despite its simplicity, miniCodeProps is sufficient to break current LLM-based provers, with state-of-the-art methods showing promise on the easy properties in miniCodeProps, yet failing to prove nearly all of the medium and hard properties. We publicly release miniCodeProps as a benchmark for furthering automated theorem proving in the context of formally verified code.</p></details> |

For example large language models have empirically proven to be capable of producing text of high complexity and cohesion. However, they are prone to inaccuracies and hallucinations. As these systems are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their safety and reliability becomes a primary concern. There are safety critical contexts where such models must be robust to variability or attack, and give guarantees over their output. Computer Vision had pioneered the use of formal verification of neural networks for such scenarios and developed common verification standards and pipelines, leveraging precise formal reasoning about geometric properties of data manifolds. In contrast, NLP verification methods have only recently appeared in the literature. While presenting sophisticated algorithms, these papers have not yet crystallised into a common methodology. They are often light on the pragmatical issues of NLP verification and the area remains fragmented. In this paper, we attempt to distil and evaluate general components of an NLP verification pipeline, that emerges from the progress in the field to date. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we propose a general methodology to analyse the effect of the embedding gap, a problem that refers to the discrepancy between verification of geometric subspaces and the semantic meaning of sentences, which the geometric subspaces are supposed to represent. We propose a number of practical NLP methods that can help to quantify the effects of the embedding gap. Secondly, we give a general method for training and verification of neural networks that leverages a more precise geometric estimation of semantic similarity of sentences in the embedding space and helps to overcome the effects of the embedding gap in practice.</p></details> |

Research in the area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often complex and difficult to replicate. Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for fair and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP. We demonstrate BAIT's capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding. We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT will be a springboard for future research.</p></details> |

Yet light to major manual input from users remains most often required for obtaining the corresponding variants of theorems, when such obvious replacements are typically left implicit on paper. This article presents Trocq, a new proof transfer framework for dependent type theory. Trocq is based on a novel formulation of type equivalence, used to generalize the univalent parametricity translation. This framework takes care of avoiding dependency on the axiom of univalence when possible, and may be used with more relations than just equivalences. We have implemented a corresponding plugin for the Coq proof assistant, in the CoqElpi meta-language. We use this plugin on a gallery of representative examples of proof transfer issues in interactive theorem proving, and illustrate how Trocq covers the spectrum of several existing tools, used in program verification as well as in formalized mathematics in the broad sense.</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their full potential, particularly concerning the mitigation of hallucinations and refinement through prover error messages, remains an area that has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in the field, we introduce the Lyra, a new framework that employs two distinct correction mechanisms: Tool Correction (TC) and Conjecture Correction (CC). To implement Tool Correction in the post-processing of formal proofs, we leverage prior knowledge to utilize predefined prover tools (e.g., Sledgehammer) for guiding the replacement of incorrect tools. Tool Correction significantly contributes to mitigating hallucinations, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the proof. In addition, we introduce Conjecture Correction, an error feedback mechanism designed to interact with prover to refine formal proof conjectures with prover error messages. Compared to the previous refinement framework, the proposed Conjecture Correction refines generation with instruction but does not collect paired (generation, error & refinement) prompts. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both miniF2F validation (48.0% -> 55.3%) and test (45.5% -> 51.2%). We also present 3 IMO problems solved by Lyra. We believe Tool Correction (post-process for hallucination mitigation) and Conjecture Correction (subgoal adjustment from interaction with environment) could provide a promising avenue for future research in this field.</p></details> |

The translation provides a formal semantics for portions of SUMO which are beyond first-order and which have previously only had an informal interpretation. It also for the first time embeds a large common-sense ontology into a very secure interactive theorem proving system. We further extend our previous work in finding contradictions in SUMO from first order constructs to include a portion of SUMO's higher order constructs. Finally, using the translation, we can create problems that can be proven using higher-order interactive and automated theorem provers. This is tested in several systems and can be used to form a corpus of higher-order common-sense reasoning problems.</p></details> |

Traditionally, symbolic methods that rely on extensive domain knowledge and engineering effort are applied to this task. In contrast, this work demonstrates that contrastive training with the transformer architecture can achieve higher-quality retrieval of relevant premises, without the engineering overhead. Our method, Magnushammer, outperforms the most advanced and widely used automation tool in interactive theorem proving called Sledgehammer. On the PISA and miniF2F benchmarks Magnushammer achieves $59.5\%$ (against $38.3\%$) and $34.0\%$ (against $20.9\%$) success rates, respectively. By combining \method with a language-model-based automated theorem prover, we further improve the state-of-the-art proof success rate from $57.0\%$ to $71.0\%$ on the PISA benchmark using $4$x fewer parameters. Moreover, we develop and open source a novel dataset for premise selection, containing textual representations of (proof state, relevant premise) pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available premise selection dataset, and the first one for the Isabelle proof assistant.</p></details> |

Specifically, we formalise graphs, graph morphisms and rules, and a definition of direct derivations based on deletion and gluing. We then formalise graph pushouts and prove with Isabelle's help that both deletions and gluings are pushouts. We also prove that pushouts are unique up to isomorphism. The formalisation comprises around 2000 lines of source text. Our motivation is to pave the way for rigorous, machine-checked proofs in the theory of the double-pushout approach, and to lay the foundations for verifying graph transformation systems and rule-based graph programs by interactive theorem proving.</p></details> |

Commonly, anti-patterns that cause quality issues are known to experienced users. However, in many theorem prover systems, there are no automatic tools to check for their presence and make less experienced users aware of them. We attempt to fill this gap in the Isabelle environment by developing a linter as a publicly available add-on component. The linter offers basic configurability, extensibility, Isabelle/jEdit integration, and a standalone command-line tool. We uncovered 480 potential problems in Isabelle/HOL, 14016 in other formalizations of the Isabelle distribution, and an astonishing 59573 in the AFP. With a specific lint bundle for AFP submissions, we found that submission guidelines were violated in 1595 cases. We set out to alleviate problems in Isabelle/HOL and solved 168 of them so far; we found that high-severity lints corresponded to actual problems most of the time, individual users often made the same mistakes in many places, and that solving those problems retrospectively amounts to a substantial amount of work. In contrast, solving these problems interactively for new developments usually incurs only little overhead, as we found in a quantitative user survey with 22 participants (less than a minute for more than 60% of participants). We also found that a good explanation of problems is key to the users' ease of solving these problems (correlation coefficient 0.48), and their satisfaction with the end result (correlation coefficient 0.62).</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert a large class of width-based model-checking algorithms into algorithms that can be used to test the validity of graph-theoretic conjectures on classes of graphs of bounded width. Our framework is modular and can be applied with respect to several well-studied width measures for graphs, including treewidth and cliquewidth. As a quantitative application of our framework, we prove analytically that for several long-standing graph-theoretic conjectures, there exists an algorithm that takes a number $k$ as input and correctly determines in time double-exponential in $k^{O(1)}$ whether the conjecture is valid on all graphs of treewidth at most $k$. These upper bounds, which may be regarded as upper-bounds on the size of proofs/disproofs for these conjectures on the class of graphs of treewidth at most $k$, improve significantly on theoretical upper bounds obtained using previously available techniques.</p></details> |

Untrusted automation procedures reside outside of the kernel, and drive it to deduce new theorems via an API. Kernel and untrusted automation are typically implemented in the same programming language -- the "meta-language" -- usually some functional programming language in the ML family. This strategy -- introduced by Milner in his LCF proof assistant -- is a reliability mechanism, aiming to ensure that any purported theorem produced by the system is indeed entailed by the theory within the logic. Changing tack, operating systems are also typically designed around a trusted kernel, a privileged component responsible for -- amongst other things -- mediating interaction betwixt user-space software and hardware. Untrusted processes interact with the system by issuing kernel system calls across a hardware privilege boundary. In this way, the operating system kernel supervises user-space processes. Though ostensibly very different, squinting, we see that the two kinds of kernel are tasked with solving the same task: enforcing system invariants in the face of unbounded interaction with untrusted code. Yet, the two solutions to solving this problem, employed by the respective kinds of kernel, are very different. In this abstract, we explore designing proof-checking kernels as supervisory software, where separation between kernel and untrusted code is enforced by privilege, not programming language module boundaries and type abstraction. We describe work on the Supervisionary proof-checking kernel, and briefly sketch its unique system interface. We then describe some potential uses of the Supervisionary kernel.</p></details> |
