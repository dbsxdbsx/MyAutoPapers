| **1** | **[Enhancing Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18573v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on: https://github.com/LiaoMengqi/E3-RL4LLMs</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Efficient RL Training for Reasoning Models via Length-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12284v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Synthetic Data RL: Task Definition Is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17063v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9 pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA (finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation, Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation. Code and demos are available at https://github.com/gydpku/Data_Synthesis_RL/.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Vision Language Model Distillation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP49660.2025.10888998)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recent research highlights the potential of multimodal foundation models in tackling complex decision-making challenges. However, their large parameters make real-world deployment resource-intensive and often impractical for constrained systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for task-specific agents but suffers from high sample complexity, limiting practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM to Policy (LVLM2P), a novel framework that distills knowledge from large vision-language models (LVLM) into more efficient RL agents. Our approach leverages the LVLM as a teacher, providing instructional actions based on trajectories collected by the RL agent, which helps reduce less meaningful exploration in the early stages of learning, thereby significantly accelerating the agent's learning progress. Additionally, by leveraging the LVLM to suggest actions directly from visual observations, we eliminate the need for manual textual descriptors of the environment, enhancing applicability across diverse tasks. Experiments show that LVLM2P significantly enhances the sample efficiency of baseline RL algorithms.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[RL-DAUNCE: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Data Assimilation with Uncertainty-Aware Constrained Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation. While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Token-Efficient RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20834v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19989v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: https://gcr-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Sequential Monte Carlo for Policy Optimization in Continuous POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16732v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing methods struggle to act under uncertainty.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Learning POMDPs with Linear Function Approximation and Finite Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14879v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation and finite-memory approximations for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We first present an algorithm for the value evaluation of finite-memory feedback policies. We provide error bounds derived from filter stability and projection errors. We then study the learning of finite-memory based near-optimal Q values. Convergence in this case requires further assumptions on the exploration policy when using general basis functions. We then show that these assumptions can be relaxed for specific models such as those with perfectly linear cost and dynamics, or when using discretization based basis functions.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Confidence-Regulated Generative Diffusion Models for Reliable AI Agent Migration in Vehicular Metaverses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12710v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles, users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs, thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber attacks.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Unveiling the Black Box: A Multi-Layer Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning-Based Cyber Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11708v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque, hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker agents that reveals both strategic (MDP-level) and tactical (policy-level) reasoning. At the MDP level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy level, we analyse the temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences. Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike previous explainable RL methods, which are often post-hoc, domain-specific, or limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic, supporting use cases ranging from red-team simulation to RL policy debugging. By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence, our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate, analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Model Identification Adaptive Control with $ρ$-POMDP Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09119v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Accurate system modeling is crucial for safe, effective control, as misidentification can lead to accumulated errors, especially under partial observability. We address this problem by formulating informative input design and model identification adaptive control (MIAC) as belief space planning problems, modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes with belief-dependent rewards ($\rho$-POMDPs). We treat system parameters as hidden state variables that must be localized while simultaneously controlling the system. We solve this problem with an adapted belief-space iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (BiLQR). We demonstrate it on fully and partially observable tasks for cart-pole and steady aircraft flight domains. Our method outperforms baselines such as regression, filtering, and local optimal control methods, even under instantaneous disturbances to system parameters.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Value Gradients with Action Adaptive Search Trees in Continuous (PO)MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12181v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in continuous state, action and observation spaces is key for autonomous planning in many real-world mobility and robotics applications. Current approaches are mostly sample based, and cannot hope to reach near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. We propose two complementary theoretical contributions. First, we formulate a novel Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) tree for value estimation, that allows to share value information between sibling action branches. The novel MIS tree supports action updates during search time, such as gradient-based updates. Second, we propose a novel methodology to compute value gradients with online sampling based on transition likelihoods. It is applicable to MDPs, and we extend it to POMDPs via particle beliefs with the application of the propagated belief trick. The gradient estimator is computed in practice using the MIS tree with efficient Monte Carlo sampling. These two parts are combined into a new planning algorithm Action Gradient Monte Carlo Tree Search (AGMCTS). We demonstrate in a simulated environment its applicability, advantages over continuous online POMDP solvers that rely solely on sampling, and we discuss further implications.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[POPGym Arcade: Parallel Pixelated POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01450v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present the POPGym Arcade, a collection of hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments with shared observation and action spaces. Each environment includes fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. We also introduce mathematical tools for analyzing policies under partial observability, which reveal how agents recall past information to make decisions. Our analysis shows (1) that controlling for partial observability is critical and (2) that agents with long-term memory learn brittle policies that struggle to generalize. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent policies can be "poisoned" by old, out-of-distribution observations, with implications for sim-to-real transfer, imitation learning, and offline reinforcement learning.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Map Space Belief Prediction for Manipulation-Enhanced Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20606v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Searching for objects in cluttered environments requires selecting efficient viewpoints and manipulation actions to remove occlusions and reduce uncertainty in object locations, shapes, and categories. In this work, we address the problem of manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping, where a robot has to efficiently identify all objects in a cluttered shelf. Although Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes~(POMDPs) are standard for decision-making under uncertainty, representing unstructured interactive worlds remains challenging in this formalism. To tackle this, we define a POMDP whose belief is summarized by a metric-semantic grid map and propose a novel framework that uses neural networks to perform map-space belief updates to reason efficiently and simultaneously about object geometries, locations, categories, occlusions, and manipulation physics. Further, to enable accurate information gain analysis, the learned belief updates should maintain calibrated estimates of uncertainty. Therefore, we propose Calibrated Neural-Accelerated Belief Updates (CNABUs) to learn a belief propagation model that generalizes to novel scenarios and provides confidence-calibrated predictions for unknown areas. Our experiments show that our novel POMDP planner improves map completeness and accuracy over existing methods in challenging simulations and successfully transfers to real-world cluttered shelves in zero-shot fashion.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Simplifying Complex Observation Models in Continuous POMDP Planning with Probabilistic Guarantees and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07745v5)** | 2023-11-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with high dimensional and continuous observations, such as camera images, is required for many real life robotics and planning problems. Recent researches suggested machine learned probabilistic models as observation models, but their use is currently too computationally expensive for online deployment. We deal with the question of what would be the implication of using simplified observation models for planning, while retaining formal guarantees on the quality of the solution. Our main contribution is a novel probabilistic bound based on a statistical total variation distance of the simplified model. We show that it bounds the theoretical POMDP value w.r.t. original model, from the empirical planned value with the simplified model, by generalizing recent results of particle-belief MDP concentration bounds. Our calculations can be separated into offline and online parts, and we arrive at formal guarantees without having to access the costly model at all during planning, which is also a novel result. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation how to integrate the bound into the routine of an existing continuous online POMDP solver.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19850v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise - requiring efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment - and overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with superhuman ability. We argue that solving complex and high-dimensional tasks requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task. In contrast, most prior work designs strategies for selecting exploratory tasks with the objective of solving any task, making exploration of challenging high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We find that the sense of direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without needing any prior information. Based on this finding, we propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the space of all tasks. Empirically, we perform a thorough evaluation in high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[STAR-R1: Spatial TrAnsformation Reasoning by Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15804v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets. With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging. Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks. Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01114v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459v2)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/dyunis/subwords_as_skills}.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Language Reward Modulation for Pretraining Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12270v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Using learned reward functions (LRFs) as a means to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has yielded some steady progress in task-complexity through the years. In this work, we question whether today's LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p></details> |

However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.</p></details> |

Detecting Deception in Negotiations using Counterfactual RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12436v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>An increasingly prevalent socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Counterfactual-Based Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09092v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms usually require a substantial amount of interaction data and perform well only for specific tasks in a fixed environment. In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few records are available for each patient, and patients may show different responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real (possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

While the synthetic control approach has gained popularity for estimating counterfactual outcomes, we caution researchers against assuming a common nonstationary trend factor across units for macroeconomic outcomes, as doing so may result in misleading causal estimation-a pitfall we refer to as the spurious synthetic control problem. To address this issue, we propose a synthetic business cycle framework that explicitly separates trend and cyclical components. By leveraging the treated unit's historical data to forecast its trend and using control units only for cyclical fluctuations, our divide-and-conquer strategy eliminates spurious correlations and improves the robustness of counterfactual prediction in macroeconomic applications. As empirical illustrations, we examine the cases of German reunification and the handover of Hong Kong, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

Since Costner (1971) and Bagozzi (1977), methodological discussions of experiments with latent outcomes have reviewed the modeling assumptions that are invoked when the quantity of interest is the average treatment effect (ATE) of a randomized intervention on a latent outcome that is measured with error. Many authors have proposed methods to estimate this ATE when multiple measures of an outcome are available. Despite this extensive literature, social scientists rarely use these modeling approaches when analyzing experimental data, perhaps because the surge of interest in experiments coincides with increased skepticism about the modeling assumptions that these methods invoke. The present paper takes a fresh look at the use of latent variable models to analyze experiments. Like the skeptics, we seek to minimize reliance on ad hoc assumptions that are not rooted in the experimental design and measurement strategy. At the same time, we think that some of the misgivings that are frequently expressed about latent variable models can be addressed by modifying the research design in ways that make the underlying assumptions defensible or testable. We describe modeling approaches that enable researchers to identify and estimate key parameters of interest, suggest ways that experimental designs can be augmented so as to make the modeling requirements more credible, and discuss empirical tests of key modeling assumptions. Simulations and an empirical application illustrate the gains in terms of precision and robustness.</p></details> |

This assumption does not consider confusion factors, which can affect medical images, such as complex anatomical variations and imaging modality limitations. Confusion factors obfuscate the relevance and causality of medical image segmentation, leading to unsatisfactory segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose a multi-causal aware modeling backdoor-intervention optimization (MAMBO-NET) network for medical image segmentation. Drawing insights from causal inference, MAMBO-NET utilizes self-modeling with multi-Gaussian distributions to fit the confusion factors and introduce causal intervention into the segmentation process. Moreover, we design appropriate posterior probability constraints to effectively train the distributions of confusion factors. For the distributions to effectively guide the segmentation and mitigate and eliminate the Impact of confusion factors on the segmentation, we introduce classical backdoor intervention techniques and analyze their feasibility in the segmentation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on five medical image datasets. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the influence of confusion factors, leading to enhanced segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |

Since clusters act as their own control, the CRXO design is typically more statistically efficient than the usual parallel-arm trial. CRXO trials are increasingly popular in many areas of health research where the number of available clusters is limited. Further, in trials among severely ill patients, researchers often want to assess the effect of treatments on secondary non-terminal outcomes, but frequently in these studies, there are patients who do not survive to have these measurements fully recorded. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework and treatment effect estimation methods for addressing truncation by death in the setting of CRXO trials. We target the survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, a well-defined subgroup treatment effect obtained via principal stratification. We propose novel structural and standard modeling assumptions to enable SACE identification followed by estimation within a Bayesian paradigm. We evaluate the small-sample performance of our proposed Bayesian approach for the estimation of the SACE in CRXO trial settings via simulation studies. We apply our methods to a previously conducted two-period cross-sectional CRXO study examining the impact of proton pump inhibitors compared to histamine-2 receptor blockers on length of hospitalization among adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.</p></details> |

Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |

Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> |

A wide range of frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications. These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and explicit definitions.</p></details> |

While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.</p></details> |

Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation on https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics.</p></details> |

It requires understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing inference costs and spurious correlations.</p></details> |

To address this, we are pioneers in establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework, we propose a novel counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories. Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables stable RFT in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset CXR-CounterFact (CCF), comprising 320,416 meticulously curated counterfactual reasoning trajectories derived from MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public.</p></details> |

By generating and analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[Beyond the Known: Decision Making with Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09114v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |
| **14** | **[An Identifiable Cost-Aware Causal Decision-Making Framework Using Counterfactual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08343v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios, existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.</p></details> |

To simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications. Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of our method and the correctness of the theory.</p></details> |

Counterfactual inference allows us to create hypothetical scenarios to examine the effects of alternative system responses. We enhance this process through causal discovery, which identifies the strategies informed by the underlying causal structure that govern system behaviors. Moreover, we consider the psychological constructs and unobservable noises that might be influencing user-system interactions as latent factors. We show that these factors can be effectively estimated. We employ causal discovery to identify strategy-level causal relationships among user and system utterances, guiding the generation of personalized counterfactual dialogues. We model the user utterance strategies as causal factors, enabling system strategies to be treated as counterfactual actions. Furthermore, we optimize policies for selecting system responses based on counterfactual data. Our results using a real-world dataset on social good demonstrate significant improvements in persuasive system outcomes, with increased cumulative rewards validating the efficacy of causal discovery in guiding personalized counterfactual inference and optimizing dialogue policies for a persuasive dialogue system.</p></details> |

To this end, prediction-powered inference has risen as a promising methodology, but existing approaches are largely limited to Z-estimation problems such as inference of means and quantiles. In this paper, we apply ideas of prediction-powered inference to e-values. By doing so, we inherit all the usual benefits of e-values -- such as anytime-validity, post-hoc validity and versatile sequential inference -- as well as greatly expand the set of inferences achievable in a prediction-powered manner. In particular, we show that every inference procedure that can be framed in terms of e-values has a prediction-powered counterpart, given by our method. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework across a wide range of inference tasks, from simple hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to more involved procedures for change-point detection and causal discovery, which were out of reach of previous techniques. Our approach is modular and easily integrable into existing algorithms, making it a compelling choice for practical applications.</p></details> |

This study develops semiparametric efficient estimators for ATE in a setting where only a treatment group and an unlabeled group, consisting of units whose treatment status is unknown, are observed. This scenario constitutes a variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) and can be viewed as a special case of ATE estimation with missing data. For this setting, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bounds, which characterize the lowest achievable asymptotic variance for regular estimators. We then construct semiparametric efficient ATE estimators that attain these bounds. Our results contribute to the literature on causal inference with missing data and weakly supervised learning.</p></details> |
| **19** | **[Integer Programming for Generalized Causal Bootstrap Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21464v3)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In experimental causal inference, we distinguish between two sources of uncertainty: design uncertainty, due to the treatment assignment mechanism, and sampling uncertainty, when the sample is drawn from a super-population. This distinction matters in settings with small fixed samples and heterogeneous treatment effects, as in geographical experiments. The standard bootstrap procedure most often used by practitioners primarily estimates sampling uncertainty, and the causal bootstrap procedure, which accounts for design uncertainty, was developed for the completely randomized design and the difference-in-means estimator, whereas non-standard designs and estimators are often used in these low-power regimes. We address this gap by proposing an integer program which computes numerically the worst-case copula used as an input to the causal bootstrap method, in a wide range of settings. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic validity of our approach for unconfounded, conditionally unconfounded, and and individualistic with bounded confoundedness assignments, as well as generalizing to any linear-in-treatment and quadratic-in-treatment estimators. We demonstrate the refined confidence intervals achieved through simulations of small geographical experiments.</p></details> |

Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing predictive robustness. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data center system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[Identifying perturbation targets through causal differential networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03380v3)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system enables applications in drug target discovery and cell engineering. Given a pair of observational and interventional datasets, the goal is to isolate the subset of observed variables that were the targets of the intervention. Directly applying causal discovery algorithms is challenging: the data may contain thousands of variables with as few as tens of samples per intervention, and biological systems do not adhere to classical causality assumptions. We propose a causality-inspired approach to address this practical setting. First, we infer noisy causal graphs from the observational and interventional data. Then, we learn to map the differences between these graphs, along with additional statistical features, to sets of variables that were intervened upon. Both modules are jointly trained in a supervised framework, on simulated and real data that reflect the nature of biological interventions. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We also demonstrate significant improvements over current causal discovery methods for predicting soft and hard intervention targets across a variety of synthetic data.</p></details> |

A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |

For example, in air pollution epidemiology, modeled estimates for multiple air pollutants and meteorological factors may serve as surrogates for exposures and confounders. Methods for simultaneously addressing EME and CME remain understudied. We developed a two-stage causal effect modeling framework to estimate average exposure/treatment effects (AEE) by addressing EME and CME. We identified conditions under which AEE is identifiable with minimal bias given linear or non-linear potential outcomes models and developed a new method, referred to as multi-dimensional regression calibration (MRC). The first stage of the framework estimates MRC models. The second stage estimates AEE by using g-computation with MR-Calibrated variables. Simulation analyses confirmed the bias-correction capability. As an application, we analyzed the association between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in Cook County, Illinois. We developed machine learning-based 500m-gridded daily estimates of air pollutants and meteorological factors in a way for what we refer to as doubly EME&CME-correction. Using distributed lag variables, a one interquartile range (22.7ppb) increase in 3-week O3 exposure below 70ppb was associated with an 135.3% (95% CI: 68.4, 233.0) increase in COVID-19 mortality risk, comparable to that for PM2.5 exposure, which contradicts the previously reported no association for 3-week O3 in Cook County. At low levels, reducing pollution may have helped prevent premature deaths from COVID-19. Our new framework can address measurement error in multiple covariates simultaneously.</p></details> |

This bias includes overt bias from inexact matching on measured confounders and hidden bias from the existence of unmeasured confounders. Researchers commonly apply the Rosenbaum-type sensitivity analysis framework after matching to assess the impact of these biases on causal conclusions. In this work, we show that this approach is often conservative and may overstate sensitivity to confounding bias because the classical solution to the Rosenbaum sensitivity model may allocate hypothetical hidden bias in ways that contradict the overt bias observed in the matched dataset. To address this problem, we propose an approach to enhance Rosenbaum-type sensitivity analysis by ensuring compatibility between hidden and overt biases. The main idea is to use post-matching overt bias information as a valid negative control to restrict the feasible set of hidden bias in sensitivity analysis. Our approach does not need to add any additional assumptions (beyond some mild regularity conditions) to Rosenbaum-type sensitivity analysis, and can produce uniformly more informative sensitivity analysis results than the conventional approach to Rosenbaum-type sensitivity analysis. Computationally, we show that our approach can be solved efficiently via iterative convex programming. Extensive simulations and a real data application demonstrate substantial gains in statistical power of sensitivity analysis. Importantly, the idea of our approach can also be directly applied to many other sensitivity analysis frameworks.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[UltraVSR: Achieving Ultra-Realistic Video Super-Resolution with Efficient One-Step Diffusion Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19958v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</p></details> |

However, the dozens of sampling steps they require, make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.</p></details> |

Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.</p></details> |

Variations in equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial improvements for downstream applications.</p></details> |

While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.</p></details> |

The problem of feature redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also similar to each other, so we propose to use "Ghost features" to reduce this redundancy. We also analyze the so-called "gradient disappearance" phenomenon generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the video are also better preserved.</p></details> |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> |

Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart.</p></details> |

However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

Our system leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+ million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric knowledge in large language models.</p></details> |

In several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.</p></details> |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> |

While previous studies have built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation, we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges, as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may result in incorrect responses.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Rethinking Regularization Methods for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23442v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential. This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.</p></details> |

While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e., few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt, demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data selection methods.</p></details> |

Experiences with Modeling Travel Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23262v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>As a specific domain of subjective well-being, travel satisfaction has attracted much research attention recently. Previous studies primarily use statistical models and, more recently, machine learning models to explore the determinants of travel satisfaction. Both approaches require data from sufficient sample sizes and correct prior statistical assumptions. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new modeling approach that can overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods. Pre-trained on extensive datasets, LLMs have strong capabilities in contextual understanding and generalization, significantly reducing their dependence on large quantities of task-specific data and stringent statistical assumptions. The primary challenge in applying LLMs lies in addressing the behavioral misalignment between LLMs and human behavior. Using data on travel satisfaction from a household survey in shanghai, this study identifies the existence and source of misalignment and develop methods to address the misalignment issue. We find that the zero-shot LLM exhibits behavioral misalignment, resulting in relatively low prediction accuracy. However, few-shot learning, even with a limited number of samples, allows the model to outperform baseline models in MSE and MAPE metrics. This misalignment can be attributed to the gap between the general knowledge embedded in LLMs and the specific, unique characteristics of the dataset. On these bases, we propose an LLM-based modeling approach that can be applied to model travel behavior using samples of small sizes. This study highlights the potential of LLMs for modeling not only travel satisfaction but also broader aspects of travel behavior.</p></details> |

However, varying response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations, exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints.</p></details> |

The model is designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.</p></details> |

These issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the research community in enhancing the security verification process.</p></details> |

However, optimizing these hybrid models, particularly by addressing the potential redundancy inherent within the Transformer components, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RAD (Redundancy-Aware Distillation), a novel framework that uses self-speculative decoding as a diagnostic tool to identify redundant attention layers within the model. These identified layers are then selectively replaced with SSM components, followed by targeted (self-)distillation. Specifically, RAD focuses knowledge transfer on the components identified as redundant, considering architectural changes and specific weight initialization strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that self-distillation using RAD significantly surpasses the performance of the original base model on mathematical and coding tasks. Furthermore, RAD is also effective in standard knowledge distillation settings, achieving up to approximately 2x faster convergence compared to baseline methods. Notably, while a baseline model distilled from a Llama-3.1 70B teacher achieves scores of 46.17 on GSM8K and 22.75 on CRUX, RAD achieves significantly higher scores of 71.27 on GSM8K and 28.25 on CRUX, even when using a much smaller Llama-3.1 8B teacher. RAD offers a new pathway for efficient optimization and performance enhancement in the distillation of hybrid models.</p></details> |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a promising approach to unleash the potential of SAM in novel scenarios. However, existing PEFT methods for SAM neglect the domain-invariant relations encoded in the pre-trained model. To bridge this gap, we propose InfoSAM, an information-theoretic approach that enhances SAM fine-tuning by distilling and preserving its pre-trained segmentation knowledge. Specifically, we formulate the knowledge transfer process as two novel mutual information-based objectives: (i) to compress the domain-invariant relation extracted from pre-trained SAM, excluding pseudo-invariant information as possible, and (ii) to maximize mutual information between the relational knowledge learned by the teacher (pre-trained SAM) and the student (fine-tuned model).

We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3) fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs. 15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.</p></details> |

In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given user interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly built on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly injecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module blocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the core self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally powerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to improve the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of enhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal self-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective problem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing the cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in CDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also encourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on the idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight additional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play module that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders. Besides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra computational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. AutoCDSR on average improves Recall@10 for SASRec and Bert4Rec by 9.8% and 16.0% and NDCG@10 by 12.0% and 16.7%, respectively.

Aspect extraction forms the foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of FCKT. The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.</p></details> |

Initially, we employ the causal graph method to scrutinize the constraints of existing research in comprehensively modeling the causal relationships between the air quality index (AQI) and meteorological features. In order to enhance prediction accuracy, we introduce a novel air quality forecasting model, AirCade, which incorporates a causal decoupling approach. AirCade leverages a spatiotemporal module in conjunction with knowledge embedding techniques to capture the internal dynamics of AQI. Subsequently, a causal decoupling module is proposed to disentangle synchronous causality from past AQI and meteorological features, followed by the dissemination of acquired knowledge to future time steps to enhance performance. Additionally, we introduce a causal intervention mechanism to explicitly represent the uncertainty of future meteorological features, thereby bolstering the model's robustness. Our evaluation of AirCade on an open-source air quality dataset demonstrates over 20\% relative improvement over state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |

However, working with the SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.</p></details> |

At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[Balancing Computation Load and Representation Expressivity in Parallel Hybrid Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19472v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).</p></details> |

Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging, novel scenarios.</p></details> |
| **23** | **[Disentangling Knowledge Representations for Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18774v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and -unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining competitive general editing performance.</p></details> |
| **24** | **[Automated Capability Evaluation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17228v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Current evaluation frameworks for foundation models rely heavily on fixed, manually curated benchmarks, limiting their ability to capture the full breadth of model capabilities. This paper introduces Active learning for Capability Evaluation (ACE), a novel framework for scalable, automated, and fine-grained evaluation of foundation models. ACE leverages the knowledge embedded in powerful language models to decompose a domain into semantically meaningful capabilities and generate diverse evaluation tasks, significantly reducing human effort. To maximize coverage and efficiency, ACE models a subject model's performance as a capability function over a latent semantic space and uses active learning to prioritize the evaluation of the most informative capabilities. This adaptive evaluation strategy enables cost-effective discovery of strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes that static benchmarks may miss. Our results suggest that ACE provides a more complete and informative picture of model capabilities, which is essential for safe and well-informed deployment of foundation models.</p></details> |

Few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |

TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.</p></details> |

To understand how language models are able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally, we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models' latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output consistency with English.</p></details> |

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.</p></details> |

Our central insight is that sample difficulty critically influences RFT effectiveness: appropriately challenging examples can drive substantial reasoning improvements, even in low-data regimes. However, quantifying sample difficulty in a reliable and scalable manner remains non-trivial. To address this, we repurpose Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to measure sample difficulty via the number of reasoning iterations a vision-language model (VLM) requires to solve each instance. This MCTS-based selection procedure identifies samples that induce deeper reasoning while remaining solvable, allowing us to filter a high-quality subset from 70k open-source examples spanning math, natural image understanding, and chart comprehension. Using this approach, we select just 11k challenging samples for RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and 7.5k samples for Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. The resulting models, ThinkLite-VL-7B and ThinkLite-VL-72B, significantly outperform their respective base models across eight visual reasoning benchmarks. In particular, ThinkLite-VL-7B improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7\% and surpasses all existing 7B-level models, as well as much larger models such as GPT-4o, O1 and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a new SoTA score of 75.1 on MathVista. ThinkLite-VL-72B further advances the SoTA frontier, achieving an accuracy of 79.7 on MathVista and an average benchmark improvement of 4.42 over the open-source SOTA. These results demonstrate that MCTS-guided difficulty filtering provides a scalable and effective path toward data-efficient self-improvement in multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |

Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |

The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.</p></details> |

AI winters, such as the early 2000s, are often remembered as barren periods of innovation. This paper argues that such a perspective overlooks a crucial wave of AI that seems to be forgotten: the rise of the Semantic Web, which is based on knowledge representation, logic, and reasoning, and its interplay with intelligent Software Agents. Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models. However, before Large Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conversation, another ambitious vision emerged -- one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web users based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed to transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason, understand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant research boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted elsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this overlooked wave. By analyzing its academic impact through bibliometric data, we highlight the Semantic Web's role in AI history and its untapped potential for modern Software Agent development. Recognizing this forgotten chapter not only deepens our understanding of AI's cyclical evolution but also offers key insights for integrating emerging technologies.</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), kernel tuning remains a critical challenge due to: (1) the semantic gap between abstract tuning objective and concrete config options, (2) insufficient environmental interaction induces LLM hallucinations, and (3) the rapid evolution of kernel versions. To address these challenges, we propose BYOS, a LLM-powered framework that automates kernel tuning through three key innovations: structured knowledge construction and mapping, knowledge-driven configuration generation, and continuous knowledge maintenance. Extensive experiments show that BYOS achieves 7.1%-155.4% performance improvements over default configurations across standard OS benchmarks and real-world applications, demonstrating structured knowledge representation can overcome key limitations of pure LLM solutions for system optimization.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this challenge by utilizing unlabeled data alongside limited labeled examples, while the emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers powerful zero-shot capabilities that can further reduce labeling cost. However, directly fine-tuning large FMs is often impractical in resource-constrained settings, and na\"ively using their pseudo-labels for unlabeled data can degrade performance due to its unreliablity or domain mismatch with target task. In this work, we introduce ZeroMatch, a novel SSL framework that integrates knowledge distillation with consistency-based learning to jointly leverage labeled data, unlabeled data, and pseudo-labels from FMs. ZeroMatch enables training compact student models using only FM inference, making it suitable for low-resource environments such as personal devices with limited compute. Experiments on six vision and language classification benchmarks show that ZeroMatch consistently outperforms standard SSL and zero-shot augmented methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across a range of foundation model qualities.</p></details> |

Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically, relying on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing component-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a key insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predominantly localized to the RoI Head classifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This finding challenges conventional assumptions, motivating us to develop a framework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Replay (RePRE) mitigates classifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse prototypes represent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained prototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Projection (NSGP) is further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating the feature extractor in directions orthogonal to subspace of old inputs via gradient projection, aligning RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our simple yet effective design allows NSGP-RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings. Our work not only advances IOD methodology but also provide pivotal insights for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in IOD.

In real world settings, retrieved information can vary in complexity, yet most investigations of LM utilisation of context has been limited to synthetic text. We introduce DRUID (Dataset of Retrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-understand contexts) with real-world queries and contexts manually annotated for stance. The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complexity and diversity of realistically retrieved context. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source. Overall, our work underscores the need for real-world aligned context utilisation studies to represent and improve performance in real-world RAG settings.</p></details> |
| **38** | **[Federated Continual Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919v3)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Managing evolving graph data presents substantial challenges in storage and privacy, and training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such data often leads to catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To this end, we propose Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL) to adapt GNNs across multiple evolving graphs under storage and privacy constraints. Our empirical study highlights two core challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where clients lose prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To address these, we introduce POWER, a framework that preserves experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage locally to mitigate LGF, and leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</p></details> |

Traditionally, this task has demanded significant time and domain expertise to identify key Legal Facts and reach sound juridical conclusions. In addition, existing data with legal case similarities often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind relevance judgments. With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential in this domain. Nonetheless, the method of employing a general large language model for reliable relevance judgments in legal case retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in research, we propose a novel few-shot approach where LLMs assist in generating expert-aligned interpretable relevance judgments. The proposed approach decomposes the judgment process into several stages, mimicking the workflow of human annotators and allowing for the flexible incorporation of expert reasoning to improve the accuracy of relevance judgments. Importantly, it also ensures interpretable data labeling, providing transparency and clarity in the relevance assessment process. Through a comparison of relevance judgments made by LLMs and human experts, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield reliable and valid relevance assessments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with minimal expert supervision, our approach enables a large language model to acquire case analysis expertise and subsequently transfers this ability to a smaller model via annotation-based knowledge distillation.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Circular Game Coloring of Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21586v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We extend the theory of circular game chromatic numbers to signed graphs by defining the invariant $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ for signed graphs $(G,\sigma)$. Our analysis establishes tight bounds dependent on the structural properties of the underlying graph $G$ and its signature $\sigma$. Building on the foundational framework of Lin and Zhu \cite{LinZhu2009}, we demonstrate that the circular game chromatic number of a balanced signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ equals that of its underlying graph $G$, i.e., $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma) = \chi_c^g(G)$. For antibalanced signed graphs, we prove that $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ does not exceed the chromatic number of $G$ plus one, with tightness demonstrated for odd cycles. A dichotomy emerges for bipartite graphs: $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ equals $2$ when the graph is balanced, and otherwise remains bounded above by $3$. These results rely on switching equivalence principles (Lemma \ref{lem:Zaslavsky}) and critical properties of fundamental cycles (Lemma \ref{lem:ForcingTree}), adapting classical techniques from unsigned graph theory to the signed context. We further highlight open questions regarding computational complexity and planar graph extensions, creating new bridges between combinatorial game theory and signed graph structural analysis.</p></details> |

From experimental results, we find relevance to graph theory, matrix representation, and mathematical consciousness. We prove that the decision strategy of movement for Xi Gua Qi and Chinese checker games belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group over set Y={-1,0,1}. Additionally, the movement for any board game with two players belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group from the razor of Occam. We derive the closed form of the transition matrix for any board game with two players such as chess and Chinese chess. We discover that the element of the transition matrix belongs to a rational number. We propose a different methodology based on algebra theory to analyze the complexity of board games in their entirety, instead of being limited solely to endgame results. It is probable that similar decision processes of people may also belong to a matrix representation that is neither a ring nor a group.</p></details> |

While virtual reality (VR) is promising for older adults to socialize remotely, existing social VR designs primarily focus on verbal communication (e.g., reminiscent, chat). Actively engaging in shared activities is also an important aspect of social connection. We designed RemoteChess, which constructs a social community and a culturally relevant activity (i.e., Chinese chess) for older adults to play while engaging in social interaction. We conducted a user study with groups of older adults interacting with each other through RemoteChess. Our findings indicate that RemoteChess enhanced participants' social connectedness by offering familiar environments, culturally relevant social catalysts, and asymmetric interactions. We further discussed design guidelines for designing culturally relevant social activities in VR to promote social connectedness for older adults.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Temperatures of Robin Hood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07239v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Cumulative Games were introduced by Larsson, Meir, and Zick (2020) to bridge some conceptual and technical gaps between Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) and Economic Game Theory. The partizan ruleset {\sc Robin Hood} is an instance of a Cumulative Game, viz., {\sc Wealth Nim}. It is played on multiple heaps, each associated with a pair of cumulations, interpreted here as wealth. Each player chooses one of the heaps, removes tokens from that heap not exceeding their own wealth, while simultaneously diminishing the other player's wealth by the same amount. In CGT, the {\em temperature} of a {\em disjunctive sum} game component is an estimate of the urgency of moving first in that component. It turns out that most of the positions of {\sc Robin Hood} are {\em hot}. The temperature of {\sc Robin Hood} on a single large heap shows a dichotomy in behavior depending on the ratio of the wealths of the players. Interestingly, this bifurcation is related to Pingala (Fibonacci) sequences and the Golden Ratio $\phi$: when the ratio of the wealths lies in the interval $(\phi^{-1},\phi)$, the temperature increases linearly with the heap size, and otherwise it remains constant, and the mean values has a reciprocal property. It turns out that despite {\sc Robin Hood} displaying high temperatures, playing in the hottest component might be a sub-optimal strategy.</p></details> |

(''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Complete Implementation of WXF Chinese Chess Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17334v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Unlike repetitions in Western Chess where all repetitions are draws, repetitions in Chinese Chess could result in a win, draw, or loss depending on the kind of repetition being made by both players. One of the biggest hurdles facing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging games correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF rules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce several novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without compromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and we saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an increased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Maker-Breaker on Galton-Watson trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08334v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider the following combinatorial two-player game: On the random tree arising from a branching process, each round one player (Breaker) deletes an edge and by that removes the descendant and all its progeny, while the other (Maker) fixates an edge to permanently secure it from deletion. Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</p></details> |

Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[The Game Value of Sequential Compounds of Integers and Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08611v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. One of the major approaches to analyzing games in combinatorial game theory is to break down a given game position into a disjunctive sum of multiple sub-positions, then evaluate the game value of each component of the sum, and finally integrate these game values to find which player has a winning strategy in the whole position. Accordingly, finding the game value of a given position is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. The sequential compound proposed by Stromquist and Ullman is a combinatorial game consisting of two combinatorial games. In the sequential compound of games $G$ and $H$, the players make moves on $G$ until $G$ is over, and then they play on $H$. In this paper, we investigate the general properties of sequential compounds. As the main result, we give the game values of sequential compounds of a finite number of integers and stars, which are basic and typical games in combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(k log n), and this time complexity is on a par with the existing O(k log n) algorithm. We do not have any recursion overhead or stack overflow because we do not use any recursion. Therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1), and ours is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm in this respect. When k is small and n is large, our algorithm is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm. This new algorithm is based on a relation between the Josephus problem and a maximum Nim of combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1\% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold. The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p></details> |

Our focus lies on finding optimal picking strategies that facilitate an effective coordination of a multi-robot system, subject to maximizing the waste removal potential. We realize this by formulating the sorting problem as an OpenAI gym environment and training a neural network with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The objective function is set up to optimize the picking rate of the robotic system. In simulation, we draw a performance comparison to an intuitive combinatorial game theory-based approach. We show that the trained policies outperform the latter and achieve up to 16% higher picking rates. Finally, the respective algorithms are validated on a hardware setup consisting of a two-robot sorting station able to process incoming waste objects through pick-and-place operations.</p></details> |

The unique attribute of XQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically, optimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on which it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to significantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local illegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional input, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations reveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its performance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's success in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific range. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV model imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi engines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the inherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic Xiangqi players.</p></details> |

The research on recommended sequences of moves in each opening of shogi is called joseki; how to use a rook (Static Rook and Ranging Rook), or how to develop a castle, etc. Also, many pieces of tsume shogi, artistic shogi miniature problems, in which the opponent's king is checkmated by a series of checks, have been created involving various beautiful techniques such as "saw" and "puzzle ring". In addition, the rapid development of AI in recent years has led to the pursuit of the best possible moves in shogi. In this paper, we move away from the study of winning and losing in shogi and focus on the mathematical aspects of the movement of shogi pieces. We propose to correspond movements of shogi pieces to a set of geometrical patterns constructed by the shape of shogi pieces and representing the Frieze group through the condition regarding the neighborhood of arrangements of given shogi pieces. Although the discovery of this correspondence does not lead to a winning strategy for shogi, however, it does demonstrate a curious involvement between the traditional Japanese board game and Western mathematics.</p></details> |

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT.

This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.</p></details> |

Growing research efforts aim to develop LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge: agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints, such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words. (3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50 agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to facilitate future research.</p></details> |

While current code benchmarks and instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked. We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.</p></details> |

Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> |

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability.

This survey systematically reviews RL-driven techniques across the code development lifecycle, from compiler-level optimizations and resource allocation strategies to end-to-end code synthesis frameworks. We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead. By consolidating current insights and outlining future directions, this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging RL to produce more robust, efficient, and human-aligned code generation systems.</p></details> |

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> |

However, post-hoc methods perform poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection. Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning, and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |

However, most existing methods enhance subwords in a contextual phrase as independent units, potentially compromising contextual phrase integrity, leading to accuracy reduction. In this paper, we propose an encoder-based phrase-level contextualized ASR method that leverages dynamic vocabulary prediction and activation. We introduce architectural optimizations and integrate a bias loss to extend phrase-level predictions based on frame-level outputs. We also introduce a confidence-activated decoding method that ensures the complete output of contextual phrases while suppressing incorrect bias. Experiments on Librispeech and Wenetspeech datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves relative WER reductions of 28.31% and 23.49% compared to baseline, with the WER on contextual phrases decreasing relatively by 72.04% and 75.69%.</p></details> |

AISHLL-5 includes two parts: (1) over 100 hours of multi-channel speech data recorded in an electric vehicle across more than 60 real driving scenarios. This audio data consists of four far-field speech signals captured by microphones located on each car door, as well as near-field signals obtained from high-fidelity headset microphones worn by each speaker. (2) a collection of 40 hours of real-world environmental noise recordings, which supports the in-car speech data simulation. Moreover, we also provide an open-access, reproducible baseline system based on this dataset. This system features a speech frontend model that employs speech source separation to extract each speaker's clean speech from the far-field signals, along with a speech recognition module that accurately transcribes the content of each individual speaker. Experimental results demonstrate the challenges faced by various mainstream ASR models when evaluated on the AISHELL-5. We firmly believe the AISHELL-5 dataset will significantly advance the research on ASR systems under complex driving scenarios by establishing the first publicly available in-car ASR benchmark.</p></details> |

However, existing implementations lack computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers, attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed NGPU-LM is open-sourced.</p></details> |

To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.</p></details> |

While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR, a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely 50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.</p></details> |

However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.</p></details> |

Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark.

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[TwinTrack: Bridging Vision and Contact Physics for Real-Time Tracking of Unknown Dynamic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22882v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Real-time tracking of previously unseen, highly dynamic objects in contact-rich environments -- such as during dexterous in-hand manipulation -- remains a significant challenge. Purely vision-based tracking often suffers from heavy occlusions due to the frequent contact interactions and motion blur caused by abrupt motion during contact impacts. We propose TwinTrack, a physics-aware visual tracking framework that enables robust and real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of unknown dynamic objects in a contact-rich scene by leveraging the contact physics of the observed scene. At the core of TwinTrack is an integration of Real2Sim and Sim2Real. In Real2Sim, we combine the complementary strengths of vision and contact physics to estimate object's collision geometry and physical properties: object's geometry is first reconstructed from vision, then updated along with other physical parameters from contact dynamics for physical accuracy. In Sim2Real, robust pose estimation of the object is achieved by adaptive fusion between visual tracking and prediction of the learned contact physics. TwinTrack is built on a GPU-accelerated, deeply customized physics engine to ensure real-time performance. We evaluate our method on two contact-rich scenarios: object falling with rich contact impacts against the environment, and contact-rich in-hand manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, TwinTrack achieves significantly more robust, accurate, and real-time 6-DoF tracking in these challenging scenarios, with tracking speed exceeding 20 Hz.

Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than 3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision and rendering techniques.</p></details> |

This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Event-based Egocentric Human Pose Estimation in Dynamic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22007v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Estimating human pose using a front-facing egocentric camera is essential for applications such as sports motion analysis, VR/AR, and AI for wearable devices. However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in dynamic environments.</p></details> |

In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details> |

Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

Mice are the standard mammalian model system in most research fields, but the datasets available today to refine such methods focus either on simple or social behaviors. In this work, we present a video dataset of individual mice solving complex mechanical puzzles, so-called lockboxes. The more than 110 hours of total playtime show their behavior recorded from three different perspectives. As a benchmark for frame-level action classification methods, we provide human-annotated labels for all videos of two different mice, that equal 13% of our dataset. Our keypoint (pose) tracking-based action classification framework illustrates the challenges of automated labeling of fine-grained behaviors, such as the manipulation of objects. We hope that our work will help accelerate the advancement of automated action and behavior classification in the computational neuroscience community.

However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer</p></details> |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |

Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.</p></details> |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> |

Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this paper, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video inputs. In particular, by leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we propose a Gaussian visibility retention check strategy to adaptively split the video sequence into several segments and optimize them separately. Extensive experiments on Tanks and Temples, ScanNet, and a self-captured dataset show that Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |

Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches.

However, the complexity of the system, such as non-convex and non-differentiable cost functions and prolonged planning horizons often drastically increases the computation time, limiting MPC's real-world applicability. Prior works in speeding up the optimization have limitations on optimizing MPC running time directly and generalizing to hold out domains. To overcome this challenge, we develop a novel framework aiming at expediting optimization processes directly. In our framework, we combine offline self-supervised learning and online fine-tuning to improve the control performance and reduce optimization time. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel and challenging Formula 1 track driving task. Comparing to single-phase training, our approach achieves a 19.4\% reduction in optimization time and a 6.3\% improvement in tracking accuracy on zero-shot tracks.</p></details> |

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.</p></details> |

Our pipeline requires no external data or information, allowing for it to be directly applied to new datasets.

For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.</p></details> |
| **20** | **[Highly Efficient 3D Human Pose Tracking from Events with Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09681v5)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Event camera, as an asynchronous vision sensor capturing scene dynamics, presents new opportunities for highly efficient 3D human pose tracking. Existing approaches typically adopt modern-day Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as CNNs or Transformer, where sparse events are converted into dense images or paired with additional gray-scale images as input. Such practices, however, ignore the inherent sparsity of events, resulting in redundant computations, increased energy consumption, and potentially degraded performance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce the first sparse Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) framework for 3D human pose tracking based solely on events. Our approach eliminates the need to convert sparse data to dense formats or incorporate additional images, thereby fully exploiting the innate sparsity of input events. Central to our framework is a novel Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer, which enables bi-directional spatiotemporal fusion of spike pose features and provides a guaranteed similarity measurement between binary spike features in spiking attention. Moreover, we have constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset, SynEventHPD, that features a broad and diverse set of 3D human motions, as well as much longer hours of event streams. Empirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANN-based methods, requiring only 19.1% FLOPs and 3.6% energy cost. Furthermore, our approach outperforms existing SNN-based benchmarks in this task, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed SNN framework. The dataset will be released upon acceptance, and code can be found at https://github.com/JimmyZou/HumanPoseTracking_SNN.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[Unifying Tracking and Image-Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11077v2)** | 2022-11-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Objection detection (OD) has been one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.</p></details> |

The proposed method uses self-supervised learning (SSL) models to extract features from NVs and uses a classifier chain to model the label dependency between emotions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of this task compared to several baseline methods. Our proposed method obtained a mean concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of $0.725$ in the validation set and $0.739$ in the test set, while the best baseline method only obtained $0.554$ in the validation set.

Specifically, we formulate the challenge to adapt an average TTS model to the stylistic target voice with limited data from target speaker, evaluated by speaker identity and style similarity. The challenge consists of two tracks, namely few-shot track and one-shot track, where the participants are required to clone multiple target voices with 100 and 5 samples respectively. There are also two sub-tracks in each track. For sub-track a, to fairly compare different strategies, the participants are allowed to use only the training data provided by the organizer strictly. For sub-track b, the participants are allowed to use any data publicly available.

While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context, dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges: (i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible regions.</p></details> |

Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[ART-DECO: Arbitrary Text Guidance for 3D Detailizer Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20431v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.</p></details> |

However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Constructing a 3D Town from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15765v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware 3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis, Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.</p></details> |

However, generating complex 3D objects, such as plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation, which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally, PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.</p></details> |

However, these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.</p></details> |

While 3D diffusion models advance single-view reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K 3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation, integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or accessories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art techniques for both single-view head modeling and diffusion-based generation of Image-to-3D.

| **10** | **[DiMeR: Disentangled Mesh Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17670v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We propose DiMeR, a novel geometry-texture disentangled feed-forward model with 3D supervision for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. Existing methods confront two persistent obstacles: (i) textures can conceal geometric errors, i.e., visually plausible images can be rendered even with wrong geometry, producing multiple ambiguous optimization objectives in geometry-texture mixed solution space for similar objects; and (ii) prevailing mesh extraction methods are redundant, unstable, and lack 3D supervision. To solve these challenges, we rethink the inductive bias for mesh reconstruction. First, we disentangle the unified geometry-texture solution space, where a single input admits multiple feasible solutions, into geometry and texture spaces individually. Specifically, given that normal maps are strictly consistent with geometry and accurately capture surface variations, the normal maps serve as the sole input for geometry prediction in DiMeR, while the texture is estimated from RGB images. Second, we streamline the algorithm of mesh extraction by eliminating modules with low performance/cost ratios and redesigning regularization losses with 3D supervision. Notably, DiMeR still accepts raw RGB images as input by leveraging foundation models for normal prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiMeR generalises across sparse-view-, single-image-, and text-to-3D tasks, consistently outperforming baselines. On the GSO and OmniObject3D datasets, DiMeR significantly reduces Chamfer Distance by more than 30%.</p></details> |

We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization. As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.</p></details> |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |

This is derived directly from mean-shift mode seeking on the distribution, and we show that its extrema are aligned with the modes. We further derive an efficient product distribution sampling procedure to evaluate the gradient. Our method is formulated as a drop-in replacement for score distillation sampling (SDS), requiring neither model retraining nor extensive modification of the sampling procedure. We show that it exhibits superior mode alignment as well as improved convergence in both synthetic and practical setups, yielding higher-fidelity results when applied to both text-to-image and text-to-3D applications with Stable Diffusion.</p></details> |

However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image. Furthermore, by integrating a texture generation module and a human motion generation module, we produce customized physics-plausible and realistic dynamic garment demonstrations.

However, current methods usually focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D objects, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter settings at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for procedural 3D models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural models. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to generate texture for the shape produced by one setting of the procedural parameters, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other parameter settings. We also develop several techniques, including a novel UV displacement network for real-time texture transfer, the retexturing pipeline to support structural changes from discrete procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of professional procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting real-time, interactive applications.</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically address only one of these challenges, often leading to suboptimal results in semantic fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose SeMv-3D, a novel framework that jointly enhances semantic alignment and multi-view consistency in GT23D generation. At its core, we introduce Triplane Prior Learning (TPL), which effectively learns triplane priors by capturing spatial correspondences across three orthogonal planes using a dedicated Orthogonal Attention mechanism, thereby ensuring geometric consistency across viewpoints. Additionally, we present Prior-based Semantic Aligning in Triplanes (SAT), which enables consistent any-view synthesis by leveraging attention-based feature alignment to reinforce the correspondence between textual semantics and triplane representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art in multi-view consistency, while maintaining competitive performance in semantic consistency compared to methods focused solely on semantic alignment. These results emphasize the remarkable ability of our approach to effectively balance and excel in both dimensions, establishing a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |

Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a robust text-to-texture method for generating consistent and seamless textures that are well aligned with the mesh. Our method leverages state-of-the-art 2D diffusion models, including SDXL and multiple ControlNets, to capture structural features and intricate details in the generated textures. The method also employs a symmetrical view synthesis strategy combined with regional prompts for enhancing view consistency. Additionally, it introduces novel texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques, which significantly reduce the seam regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |
| **22** | **[GenesisTex2: Stable, Consistent and High-Quality Text-to-Texture Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18401v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large-scale text-guided image diffusion models have shown astonishing results in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, applying these models to synthesize textures for 3D geometries remains challenging due to the domain gap between 2D images and textures on a 3D surface. Early works that used a projecting-and-inpainting approach managed to preserve generation diversity but often resulted in noticeable artifacts and style inconsistencies. While recent methods have attempted to address these inconsistencies, they often introduce other issues, such as blurring, over-saturation, or over-smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel text-to-texture synthesis framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models. We first introduce a local attention reweighing mechanism in the self-attention layers to guide the model in concentrating on spatial-correlated patches across different views, thereby enhancing local details while preserving cross-view consistency. Additionally, we propose a novel latent space merge pipeline, which further ensures consistency across different viewpoints without sacrificing too much diversity. Our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques regarding texture consistency and visual quality, while delivering results much faster than distillation-based methods. Importantly, our framework does not require additional training or fine-tuning, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of models available on public platforms.</p></details> |

We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</p></details> |

However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.</p></details> |

However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Autoformalization in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23486v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open challenges and promising future directions for the field.</p></details> |

While simulation and emulation are widely used, complete correctness can only be ensured based on formal proof techniques. But these approaches often have very high run time and memory requirements. Recently, Polynomial Formal Verification (PFV) has been introduced showing that for many instances of practical relevance upper bounds on needed resources can be given. But proofs have to be provided that are human-readable. Here, we study how modern approaches from Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate proofs that later on can be validated based on reasoning engines. Examples are given that show how LLMs can interact with proof engines, and directions for future work are outlined.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Structural Abstraction and Selective Refinement for Formal Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22982v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Safety verification of robot applications is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the environment that a robot typically operates in. Formal verification with model-checking provides guarantees but it may often take too long or even fail for complex models of the environment. A usual solution approach is abstraction, more precisely behavioral abstraction. Our new approach introduces structural abstraction instead, which we investigated in the context of voxel representation of the robot environment. This kind of abstraction leads to abstract voxels. We also propose a complete and automated verification workflow, which is based on an already existing methodology for robot applications, and inspired by the key ideas behind counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) - performing an initial abstraction and successively introducing refinements based on counterexamples, intertwined with model-checker runs. Hence, our approach uses selective refinement of structural abstractions to improve the runtime efficiency of model-checking. A fully-automated implementation of our approach showed its feasibility, since counterexamples have been found for a realistic scenario with a fairly high (maximal) resolution in a few minutes, while direct model-checker runs led to a crash after a couple of days.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Step-Wise Formal Verification for LLM-Based Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20869v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Grammars of Formal Uncertainty: When to Trust LLMs in Automated Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20047v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering discipline.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Out of the Shadows: Exploring a Latent Space for Neural Network Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17854v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Neural networks are ubiquitous. However, they are often sensitive to small input changes. Hence, to prevent unexpected behavior in safety-critical applications, their formal verification -- a notoriously hard problem -- is necessary. Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability analysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a neural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism of the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for formal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the input space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we iteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones. The latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set representations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability analysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a "shadow" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change during a set propagation through a neural network. Hence, the input set and the output enclosure are "shadows" of the same latent space that we can use to transfer constraints. We present an efficient verification tool for neural networks that uses our iterative refinement to significantly reduce the number of subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure. Using zonotopes as a set representation, unlike many other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach can be realized by only using matrix operations, which enables a significant speed-up through efficient GPU acceleration. We demonstrate that our tool achieves competitive performance, which would place it among the top-ranking tools of the last neural network verification competition (VNN-COMP'24).</p></details> |

However, its adoption is hindered by labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code, datasets, and LLMs are open source.</p></details> |

However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval, premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.</p></details> |

But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel proof-state exploration approach for training data synthesis, designed to produce diverse tactics across a wide range of intermediate proof states, thereby facilitating effective one-shot fine-tuning of LLM as the policy model. We also propose an adaptive beam size strategy, which effectively takes advantage of our data synthesis method and achieves a trade-off between exploration and exploitation during tree search. Evaluations on the MiniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines under the stringent Pass@1 metric, attaining an average pass rate of $60.74\%$ on MiniF2F and $21.18\%$ on ProofNet. These results underscore the impact of large-scale synthetic data in advancing automated theorem proving.</p></details> |

Recent benchmarks of large language models have mainly focused on general mathematics problems and the currently infeasible objective of automated theorem proving. In the first part of this paper, we relax our ambition and focus on a more specialized domain: we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art open-source large language model Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on algorithmic and computational tasks in algorithmic number theory. On a benchmark of thirty algorithmic problems and thirty computational questions taken from classical number-theoretic textbooks and Math StackExchange, the model achieves at least 0.95 accuracy (relative to the true answer) on every problem or question when given an optimal non-spoiling hint. The second part of the paper empirically verifies a folklore conjecture in analytic number theory stating that the modulus \(q\) of a Dirichlet character \(\chi\) is uniquely determined by the initial nontrivial zeros \(\{\rho_1,\dots,\rho_k\}\) (for some \(k\in\mathbb{N}\)) of the corresponding Dirichlet \(L\)-function \(L(s,\chi)\). We train a LightGBM multiclass classifier to predict the conductor \(q\) for 214 randomly chosen Dirichlet \(L\)-functions from a vector of statistical features of their initial zeros (moments, finite-difference statistics, FFT magnitudes, etc.). The model empirically verifies the conjecture for small \(q\), achieving at least 93.9\% test accuracy when sufficient statistical properties of the zeros are incorporated. For the second part of the paper, code and dataset are available.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[On Coalgebraic Product Constructions for Markov Chains and Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06592v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Verifying traces of systems is a central topic in formal verification. We study model checking of Markov chains (MCs) against temporal properties represented as (finite) automata. For instance, given an MC and a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), a simple but practically useful model checking problem asks for the probability of traces on the MC that are accepted by the DFA. A standard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given MC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on the resulting product MC. In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we first present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we cannot do product constructions for model checking. Specifically, we show that there are no coalgebraic product MCs of MCs and nondeterministic finite automata for computing the probability of the accepting traces. This no-go theorem is established via a characterisation of natural transformations between certain functors that determine the type of branching, including nondeterministic or probabilistic branching. Second, we present a coalgebraic product construction of MCs and multiset finite automata (MFAs) as a new instance within our framework. This construction addresses a model checking problem that asks for the expected number of accepting runs on MFAs over traces of MCs. The problem is reduced to solving linear equations, which is solvable in polynomial-time under a reasonable assumption that ensures the finiteness of the solution.</p></details> |

Since many ITPs, such as Rocq and Lean, use tactic-style proofs, learning higher-level custom tactics is crucial for proof modularity and automation. This paper presents a novel approach to tactic discovery, which leverages Tactic Dependence Graphs (TDGs) to identify reusable proof strategies across multiple proofs. TDGs capture logical dependencies between tactic applications while abstracting away irrelevant syntactic details, allowing for both the discovery of new tactics and the refactoring of existing proofs into more modular forms. We have implemented this technique in a tool called TacMiner and compare it against an anti-unification-based approach Peano to tactic discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that TacMiner can learn 3x as many tactics as Peano and reduces the size of proofs by 26% across all benchmarks. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of learning custom tactics for proof automation, allowing a state-of-the-art proof automation tool to achieve a relative increase of 172% in terms of success rate.</p></details> |

State-of-the-art methods utilize a single Large Language Model (LLM) to generate complete proof or perform tree search, but they fail to balance these tasks. We propose **MA-LoT**: *Model-CollAboration Lean-based Long Chain-of-Thought*, a comprehensive framework for Lean4 theorem proving to solve this issue. It separates the cognition tasks of general NL for whole-proof generation and error analysis for proof correction using the model-collaboration method. We achieve this by structured interaction of the LLM and Lean4 verifier in Long CoT. To implement the framework, we propose the novel *LoT-Transfer Learning* training-inference pipeline, which enables the Long CoT thinking capability to LLMs without special data annotation. Extensive experiment shows that our framework achieves a **61.07%** accuracy rate on the Lean4 version of the MiniF2F-Test dataset, largely outperforming DeepSeek-V3 (33.61%), single-model tree search (InternLM-Step-Prover, 50.70%), and whole-proof generation (Godel-Prover, 55.33%) baselines. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of combining Long CoT with formal verification for a more insightful generation in a broader perspective.</p></details> |

This paper presents a method for the simultaneous deployment of deep and shallow embeddings of various degrees in classical higher-order logic. This enables flexible, interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, as well as automated faithfulness proofs between these logic embeddings. The method is beneficial for logic education, research and application and is illustrated here using a simple propositional modal logic.

When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.</p></details> |

Previously, APPS provided a benchmark and dataset for programming puzzles to be completed in Python and checked against unit tests, of the kind seen in technical assessments in the software engineering industry. Building upon recent approaches for benchmarks in interactive theorem proving, we generalize the unit tests to Lean 4 theorems given without proof (i.e., using Lean's "sorry" keyword). On the 406 theorems of 100 randomly selected samples, Sonnet correctly proves 30% and Gemini correctly proves 18%. We challenge the machine learning and program synthesis communities to solve both each general purpose programming problem and its associated correctness specifications. The benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/quinn-dougherty/fvapps.</p></details> |
| **19** | **[Learning Rules Explaining Interactive Theorem Proving Tactic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01188v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Formally verifying the correctness of mathematical proofs is more accessible than ever, however, the learning curve remains steep for many of the state-of-the-art interactive theorem provers (ITP). Deriving the most appropriate subsequent proof step, and reasoning about it, given the multitude of possibilities, remains a daunting task for novice users. To improve the situation, several investigations have developed machine learning based guidance for tactic selection. Such approaches struggle to learn non-trivial relationships between the chosen tactic and the structure of the proof state and represent them as symbolic expressions. To address these issues we (i) We represent the problem as an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) task, (ii) Using the ILP representation we enriched the feature space by encoding additional, computationally expensive properties as background knowledge predicates, (iii) We use this enriched feature space to learn rules explaining when a tactic is applicable to a given proof state, (iv) we use the learned rules to filter the output of an existing tactic selection approach and empirically show improvement over the non-filtering approaches.</p></details> |

In practice, it is mainly used for interactive theorem proving with intensional type theories, with PVS being a notable exception. In this paper, we present native rules for automated reasoning in a dependently-typed version (DHOL) of classical higher-order logic (HOL). DHOL has an extensional type theory with an undecidable type checking problem which contains theorem proving. We implemented the inference rules as well as an automatic type checking mode in Lash, a fork of Satallax, the leading tableaux-based prover for HOL. Our method is sound and complete with respect to provability in DHOL. Completeness is guaranteed by the incorporation of a sound and complete translation from DHOL to HOL recently proposed by Rothgang et al. While this translation can already be used as a preprocessing step to any HOL prover, to achieve better performance, our system directly works in DHOL. Moreover, experimental results show that the DHOL version of Lash can outperform all major HOL provers executed on the translation.</p></details> |

Research in the area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often complex and difficult to replicate. Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for fair and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP. We demonstrate BAIT's capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding. We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT will be a springboard for future research.</p></details> |
| **22** | **[Magnushammer: A Transformer-Based Approach to Premise Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04488v3)** | 2023-03-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to premise selection, a crucial reasoning task in automated theorem proving. Traditionally, symbolic methods that rely on extensive domain knowledge and engineering effort are applied to this task. In contrast, this work demonstrates that contrastive training with the transformer architecture can achieve higher-quality retrieval of relevant premises, without the engineering overhead. Our method, Magnushammer, outperforms the most advanced and widely used automation tool in interactive theorem proving called Sledgehammer. On the PISA and miniF2F benchmarks Magnushammer achieves $59.5\%$ (against $38.3\%$) and $34.0\%$ (against $20.9\%$) success rates, respectively. By combining \method with a language-model-based automated theorem prover, we further improve the state-of-the-art proof success rate from $57.0\%$ to $71.0\%$ on the PISA benchmark using $4$x fewer parameters. Moreover, we develop and open source a novel dataset for premise selection, containing textual representations of (proof state, relevant premise) pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available premise selection dataset, and the first one for the Isabelle proof assistant.</p></details> |
