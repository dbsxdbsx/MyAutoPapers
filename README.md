| **1** | **[Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Offline Robotic World Model: Learning Robotic Policies without a Physics Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16680v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in robotic control but remains challenging due to high sample complexity, safety concerns, and the sim-to-real gap. While offline RL eliminates the need for risky real-world exploration by learning from pre-collected data, it suffers from distributional shift, limiting policy generalization. Model-Based RL (MBRL) addresses this by leveraging predictive models for synthetic rollouts, yet existing approaches often lack robust uncertainty estimation, leading to compounding errors in offline settings. We introduce Offline Robotic World Model (RWM-O), a model-based approach that explicitly estimates epistemic uncertainty to improve policy learning without reliance on a physics simulator. By integrating these uncertainty estimates into policy optimization, our approach penalizes unreliable transitions, reducing overfitting to model errors and enhancing stability. Experimental results show that RWM-O improves generalization and safety, enabling policy learning purely from real-world data and advancing scalable, data-efficient RL for robotics.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Tina: Tiny Reasoning Models via LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15777v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA. We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code, training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Handling Delay in Real-Time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23478v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Real-time reinforcement learning (RL) introduces several challenges. First, policies are constrained to a fixed number of actions per second due to hardware limitations. Second, the environment may change while the network is still computing an action, leading to observational delay. The first issue can partly be addressed with pipelining, leading to higher throughput and potentially better policies. However, the second issue remains: if each neuron operates in parallel with an execution time of $\tau$, an $N$-layer feed-forward network experiences observation delay of $\tau N$. Reducing the number of layers can decrease this delay, but at the cost of the network's expressivity. In this work, we explore the trade-off between minimizing delay and network's expressivity. We present a theoretically motivated solution that leverages temporal skip connections combined with history-augmented observations. We evaluate several architectures and show that those incorporating temporal skip connections achieve strong performance across various neuron execution times, reinforcement learning algorithms, and environments, including four Mujoco tasks and all MinAtar games. Moreover, we demonstrate parallel neuron computation can accelerate inference by 6-350% on standard hardware. Our investigation into temporal skip connections and parallel computations paves the way for more efficient RL agents in real-time setting.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Provably Efficient RL for Linear MDPs under Instantaneous Safety Constraints in Non-Convex Feature Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18655v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), tasks with instantaneous hard constraints present significant challenges, particularly when the decision space is non-convex or non-star-convex. This issue is especially relevant in domains like autonomous vehicles and robotics, where constraints such as collision avoidance often take a non-convex form. In this paper, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(\bigl(1 + \tfrac{1}{\tau}\bigr) \sqrt{\log(\tfrac{1}{\tau}) d^3 H^4 K} \bigr)$, applicable to both star-convex and non-star-convex cases, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ the episode length, $K$ the number of episodes, and $\tau$ the safety threshold. Moreover, the violation of safety constraints is zero with high probability throughout the learning process. A key technical challenge in these settings is bounding the covering number of the value-function class, which is essential for achieving value-aware uniform concentration in model-free function approximation. For the star-convex setting, we develop a novel technique called Objective Constraint-Decomposition (OCD) to properly bound the covering number. This result also resolves an error in a previous work on constrained RL. In non-star-convex scenarios, where the covering number can become infinitely large, we propose a two-phase algorithm, Non-Convex Safe Least Squares Value Iteration (NCS-LSVI), which first reduces uncertainty about the safe set by playing a known safe policy. After that, it carefully balances exploration and exploitation to achieve the regret bound. Finally, numerical simulations on an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of NCS-LSVI.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Precise and Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21845v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for enabling autonomous acquisition of complex robotic manipulation skills, but realizing this potential in real-world settings has been challenging. We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements. Videos and code are available at our project website https://hil-serl.github.io/.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Uncovering RL Integration in SSL Loss: Objective-Specific Implications for Data-Efficient RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17428v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this study, we investigate the effect of SSL objective modifications within the SPR framework, focusing on specific adjustments such as terminal state masking and prioritized replay weighting, which were not explicitly addressed in the original design. While these modifications are specific to RL, they are not universally applicable across all RL algorithms. Therefore, we aim to assess their impact on performance and explore other SSL objectives that do not accommodate these adjustments like Barlow Twins and VICReg. We evaluate six SPR variants on the Atari 100k benchmark, including versions both with and without these modifications. Additionally, we test the performance of these objectives on the DeepMind Control Suite, where such modifications are absent. Our findings reveal that incorporating specific SSL modifications within SPR significantly enhances performance, and this influence extends to subsequent frameworks like SR-SPR and BBF, highlighting the critical importance of SSL objective selection and related adaptations in achieving data efficiency in self-predictive reinforcement learning.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Computationally Efficient RL under Linear Bellman Completeness for Deterministic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11810v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study computationally and statistically efficient Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the linear Bellman Complete setting. This setting uses linear function approximation to capture value functions and unifies existing models like linear Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While it is known from the prior works that this setting is statistically tractable, it remained open whether a computationally efficient algorithm exists. Our work provides a computationally efficient algorithm for the linear Bellman complete setting that works for MDPs with large action spaces, random initial states, and random rewards but relies on the underlying dynamics to be deterministic. Our approach is based on randomization: we inject random noise into least squares regression problems to perform optimistic value iteration. Our key technical contribution is to carefully design the noise to only act in the null space of the training data to ensure optimism while circumventing a subtle error amplification issue.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Learning Attentive Neural Processes for Planning with Pushing Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17924v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Our goal is to enable robots to plan sequences of tabletop actions to push a block with unknown physical properties to a desired goal pose on the table. We approach this problem by learning the constituent models of a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the robot can observe the outcome of a push, but the physical properties of the block that govern the dynamics remain unknown. The pushing problem is a difficult POMDP to solve due to the challenge of state estimation. The physical properties have a nonlinear relationship with the outcomes, requiring computationally expensive methods, such as particle filters, to represent beliefs. Leveraging the Attentive Neural Process architecture, we propose to replace the particle filter with a neural network that learns the inference computation over the physical properties given a history of actions. This Neural Process is integrated into planning as the Neural Process Tree with Double Progressive Widening (NPT-DPW). Simulation results indicate that NPT-DPW generates more effective plans faster than traditional particle filter methods, even in complex pushing scenarios.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[An Addendum to NeBula: Towards Extending TEAM CoSTAR's Solution to Larger Scale Environments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TFR.2024.3430891)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper presents an appendix to the original NeBula autonomy solution developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), participating in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, this paper presents extensions to NeBula's hardware, software, and algorithmic components that focus on increasing the range and scale of the exploration environment. From the algorithmic perspective, we discuss the following extensions to the original NeBula framework: (i) large-scale geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) an adaptive positioning system; (iii) probabilistic traversability analysis and local planning; (iv) large-scale POMDP-based global motion planning and exploration behavior; (v) large-scale networking and decentralized reasoning; (vi) communication-aware mission planning; and (vii) multi-modal ground-aerial exploration solutions. We demonstrate the application and deployment of the presented systems and solutions in various large-scale underground environments, including limestone mine exploration scenarios as well as deployment in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Integrated Control and Active Perception in POMDPs for Temporal Logic Tasks and Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13288v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper studies the synthesis of a joint control and active perception policy for a stochastic system modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), subject to temporal logic specifications. The POMDP actions influence both system dynamics (control) and the emission function (perception). Beyond task completion, the planner seeks to maximize information gain about certain temporal events (the secret) through coordinated perception and control. To enable active information acquisition, we introduce minimizing the Shannon conditional entropy of the secret as a planning objective, alongside maximizing the probability of satisfying the temporal logic formula within a finite horizon. Using a variant of observable operators in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and POMDPs, we establish key properties of the conditional entropy gradient with respect to policy parameters. These properties facilitate efficient policy gradient computation. We validate our approach through graph-based examples, inspired by common security applications with UAV surveillance.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[An Efficient Reservation Protocol for Medium Access: When Tree Splitting Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02376v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>As an enhanced version of massive machine-type communication in 5G, massive communication has emerged as one of the six usage scenarios anticipated for 6G, owing to its potential in industrial internet-of-things and smart metering. Driven by the need for random multiple-access (RMA) in massive communication, as well as, next-generation Wi-Fi, medium access control has attracted considerable recent attention. Holding the promise of attaining bandwidth-efficient collision resolution, multiaccess reservation no doubt plays a central role in RMA, e.g., the distributed coordination function (DCF) in IEEE 802.11. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of reservation protocols for RMA under quality-of-service constraints. Particularly, we present a tree splitting based reservation scheme, in which the attempting probability is dynamically optimized by partially observable Markov decision process or reinforcement learning (RL). The RL-empowered tree-splitting algorithm guarantees that all these terminals with backlogged packets at the beginning of a contention cycle can be scheduled, thereby providing a first-in-first-out service. More importantly, it substantially reduces the reservation bandwidth determined by the communication complexity of DCF, through judiciously conceived coding and interaction for exchanging information required by distributed ordering. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the CSMA/CA based DCF in IEEE 802.11.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Real-time Tracking System with Partially Coupled Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21552v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Enhancing Robustness in Language-Driven Robotics: A Modular Approach to Failure Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05474v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in robotics, enabling embodied agents to better understand and execute open-ended tasks. However, existing approaches using LLMs face limitations in grounding their outputs within the physical environment and aligning with the capabilities of the robot. This challenge becomes even more pronounced with smaller language models, which are more computationally efficient but less robust in task planning and execution. In this paper, we present a novel modular architecture designed to enhance the robustness of LLM-driven robotics by addressing these grounding and alignment issues. We formalize the task planning problem within a goal-conditioned POMDP framework, identify key failure modes in LLM-driven planning, and propose targeted design principles to mitigate these issues. Our architecture introduces an ``expected outcomes'' module to prevent mischaracterization of subgoals and a feedback mechanism to enable real-time error recovery. Experimental results, both in simulation and on physical robots, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task success rates for pick-and-place and manipulation tasks compared to both larger LLMs and standard baselines. Through hardware experiments, we also demonstrate how our architecture can be run efficiently and locally. This work highlights the potential of smaller, locally-executable LLMs in robotics and provides a scalable, efficient solution for robust task execution.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[When to Localize? A Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02788v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In a standard navigation pipeline, a robot localizes at every time step to lower navigational errors. However, in some scenarios, a robot needs to selectively localize when it is expensive to obtain observations. For example, an underwater robot surfacing to localize too often hinders it from searching for critical items underwater, such as black boxes from crashed aircraft. On the other hand, if the robot never localizes, poor state estimates cause failure to find the items due to inadvertently leaving the search area or entering hazardous, restricted areas. Motivated by these scenarios, we investigate approaches to help a robot determine "when to localize?" We formulate this as a bi-criteria optimization problem: minimize the number of localization actions while ensuring the probability of failure (due to collision or not reaching a desired goal) remains bounded. In recent work, we showed how to formulate this active localization problem as a constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which was solved using an online POMDP solver. However, this approach is too slow and requires full knowledge of the robot transition and observation models. In this paper, we present RiskRL, a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that overcomes these limitations. RiskRL uses particle filtering and recurrent Soft Actor-Critic network to learn a policy that minimizes the number of localizations while ensuring the probability of failure constraint is met. Our numerical experiments show that RiskRL learns a robust policy that leads to at least a 26% increase in success rates when traversing unseen test environments.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Belief-State Query Policies for User-Aligned POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15907v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Planning in real-world settings often entails addressing partial observability while aligning with users' requirements. We present a novel framework for expressing users' constraints and preferences about agent behavior in a partially observable setting using parameterized belief-state query (BSQ) policies in the setting of goal-oriented partially observable Markov decision processes (gPOMDPs). We present the first formal analysis of such constraints and prove that while the expected cost function of a parameterized BSQ policy w.r.t its parameters is not convex, it is piecewise constant and yields an implicit discrete parameter search space that is finite for finite horizons. This theoretical result leads to novel algorithms that optimize gPOMDP agent behavior with guaranteed user alignment. Analysis proves that our algorithms converge to the optimal user-aligned behavior in the limit. Empirical results show that parameterized BSQ policies provide a computationally feasible approach for user-aligned planning in partially observable settings.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Online POMDP Planning with Anytime Deterministic Optimality Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01791v4)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Decision-making under uncertainty is a critical aspect of many practical autonomous systems due to incomplete information. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a mathematically principled framework for formulating decision-making problems under such conditions. However, finding an optimal solution for a POMDP is generally intractable. In recent years, there has been a significant progress of scaling approximate solvers from small to moderately sized problems, using online tree search solvers. Often, such approximate solvers are limited to probabilistic or asymptotic guarantees towards the optimal solution. In this paper, we derive a deterministic relationship for discrete POMDPs between an approximated and the optimal solution. We show that at any time, we can derive bounds that relate between the existing solution and the optimal one. We show that our derivations provide an avenue for a new set of algorithms and can be attached to existing algorithms that have a certain structure to provide them with deterministic guarantees with marginal computational overhead. In return, not only do we certify the solution quality, but we demonstrate that making a decision based on the deterministic guarantee may result in superior performance compared to the original algorithm without the deterministic certification.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[A Strong Duality Result for Constrained POMDPs with Multiple Cooperative Agents](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC49753.2023.10383989)** | 2023-03-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The work studies the problem of decentralized constrained POMDPs in a team-setting where multiple nonstrategic agents have asymmetric information. Using an extension of Sion's Minimax theorem for functions with positive infinity and results on weak-convergence of measures, strong duality is established for the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs when the observations lie in a countable space, the actions are chosen from a finite space, the constraint costs are bounded, and the objective cost is bounded from below.</p></details> |
| **11** | **[Decisiveness for countable MDPs and insights for NPLCSs and POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10426v3)** | 2020-08-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs) are well-established probabilistic models. While finite Markov models are well-understood, analysing their infinite counterparts remains a significant challenge. Decisiveness has proven to be an elegant property for countable Markov chains: it is general enough to be satisfied by several natural classes of countable Markov chains, and it is a sufficient condition for simple qualitative and approximate quantitative model-checking algorithms to exist. In contrast, existing works on the formal analysis of countable MDPs usually rely on ad hoc techniques tailored to specific classes. We provide here a general framework to analyse countable MDPs by extending the notion of decisiveness. Compared to Markov chains, MDPs exhibit extra non-determinism that can be resolved in an adversarial or cooperative way, leading to multiple natural notions of decisiveness. We show that these notions enable the approximation of reachability and safety probabilities in countable MDPs using simple model-checking procedures. We then instantiate our generic approach to two concrete classes of models inducing countable MDPs: non-deterministic probabilistic lossy channel systems and partially observable MDPs. This leads to an algorithm to approximately compute safety probabilities in each of these classes.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets. With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging. Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks. Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01114v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459v2)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts.

In this work, we question whether today's LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p></details> |

However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.</p></details> |

To improve learning efficiency for such tasks, this paper proposes a DRL exploration technique, termed A^2, which integrates two components inspired by human experiences: Abstract demonstrations and Adaptive exploration. A^2 starts by decomposing a complex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to learn. During training, the agent explores the environment adaptively, acting more deterministically for well-mastered subtasks and more stochastically for ill-learnt subtasks. Ablation and comparative experiments are conducted on several grid-world tasks and three robotic manipulation tasks. We demonstrate that A^2 can aid popular DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, and SAC) to learn more efficiently and stably in these environments.</p></details> |

Detecting Deception in Negotiations using Counterfactual RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12436v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>An increasingly prevalent socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Counterfactual-Based Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09092v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms usually require a substantial amount of interaction data and perform well only for specific tasks in a fixed environment. In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few records are available for each patient, and patients may show different responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real (possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for variable selection, causal discovery, and graphical modeling for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. The key technical ingredients are time-varying nonlinear regression, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |

Matching estimators, estimators based on k-nearest neighbours, are widely used in this context. It is known that the variance of such estimators can converge to zero at a parametric rate, but their bias can have a slower rate when the dimension of the covariates is larger than 2. This makes analysis of this bias particularly important. In this paper, we provide higher order properties of the bias. In contrast to the existing literature related to this problem, we do not assume that the support of the target distribution of the covariates is strictly included in that of the source, and we analyse two geometric conditions on the support that avoid such boundary bias problems. We show that these conditions are much more general than the usual convex support assumption, leading to an improvement of existing results. Furthermore, we show that the matching estimator studied by Abadie and Imbens (2006) for the average treatment effect can be asymptotically efficient when the dimension of the covariates is less than 4, a result only known in dimension 1.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Powerful randomization tests for subgroup analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21572v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Randomization tests are widely used to generate valid $p$-values for testing sharp null hypotheses in finite-population causal inference. This article extends their application to subgroup analysis. We show that directly testing subgroup null hypotheses may lack power due to small subgroup sizes. Incorporating an estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) can substantially improve power but requires splitting the treatment variables between estimation and testing to preserve finite-sample validity. To this end, we propose BaR-learner, a Bayesian extension of the popular method R-learner for CATE estimation. BaR-learner imputes the treatment variables reserved for randomization tests, reducing information loss due to sample-splitting. Furthermore, we show that the treatment variables most informative for training BaR-learner are different from those most valuable for increasing test power. Motivated by this insight, we introduce AdaSplit, a sample-splitting procedure that adaptively allocates units between estimation and testing. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method yields more powerful randomization tests than baselines that omit CATE estimation or rely on random sample-splitting. We also apply our method to a blood pressure intervention trial, identifying patient subgroups with significant treatment effects.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Multi-Domain Causal Discovery in Bijective Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21261v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure learning) in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are invariant across the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may vary. Under causal sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the causal diagram can be discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions compared to previous work. What enables causal discovery in this setting is bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), which ensures that the functional relation between the exogenous noise $E$ and the endogenous variable $Y$ is bijective and differentiable in both directions at every level of the cause variable $X = x$. BGM generalizes a variety of models including additive noise model, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, and location-scale noise model. Further, we derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target variable. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |

This heterogeneity underscores the critical need for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high dimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations, and outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal inference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools for personalized AD prognostication.</p></details> |

Grounded in classical mechanics but extended to Economics order elasticity terms, 2HOED represents economic, social, and physical systems as energy-based Hamiltonians whose position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of elasticity jointly determine systemic power, Inertia, policy sensitivity, and marginal responses. Because the formalism is scaling free and coordinate agnostic, it transfers seamlessly from financial markets to climate science, from supply chain logistics to epidemiology, thus any discipline in which adaptation and shocks coexist. By embedding standard econometric variables inside a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enriches conventional economic analysis with rigorous diagnostics of resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops, revealing failure modes invisible to linear models. Wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams derived from 2HOED expose multistage policy leverage that machine learning detects only empirically and block chain secures only after the fact. For economists, physicians and other scientists, the method opens a new causal energetic channel linking biological or mechanical elasticity to macro level outcomes. Portable, interpretable, and computationally light, 2HOED turns data streams into dynamical energy maps, empowering decision makers to anticipate crises, design adaptive policies, and engineer robust systems delivering the predictive punch of AI with the explanatory clarity of physics.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Probabilistic and Causal Satisfiability: Constraining the Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19944v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains, the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events $X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication (polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of (in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals. Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in complexity. We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels. Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability under small-model constraints across different settings.</p></details> |

An important challenge in such settings is that standard inference methods that rely on asymptotic theory may be unreliable, even when the total number of units is large. This survey reviews and categorizes inference methods that are designed to accommodate few treated units, considering both cross-sectional and panel data methods. We discuss trade-offs and connections between different approaches. In doing so, we propose slight modifications to improve the finite-sample validity of some methods, and we also provide theoretical justifications for existing heuristic approaches that have been proposed in the literature.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[Causal-Copilot: An Autonomous Causal Analysis Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13263v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world applicability in causal analysis. A live interactive demo of Causal-Copilot is available at https://causalcopilot.com/.</p></details> |

Through structured tables and comparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices from multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and differences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers designing causal studies, especially in settings where observational or experimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all phases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of background knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study design or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support rigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[When Counterfactual Reasoning Fails: Chaos and Real-World Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23820v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Counterfactual reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition and decision-making, is often seen as the 'holy grail' of causal learning, with applications ranging from interpreting machine learning models to promoting algorithmic fairness. While counterfactual reasoning has been extensively studied in contexts where the underlying causal model is well-defined, real-world causal modeling is often hindered by model and parameter uncertainty, observational noise, and chaotic behavior. The reliability of counterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the framework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate \emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes increasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low degrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in counterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and true counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying counterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty. Furthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose fundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about their behavior.</p></details> |
| **14** | **[Counterfactual Situation Testing: From Single to Multidimensional Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01267v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present counterfactual situation testing (CST), a causal data mining framework for detecting individual discrimination in a dataset of classifier decisions. CST answers the question ``what would have been the model outcome had the individual, or complainant, been of a different protected status?'' It extends the legally-grounded situation testing (ST) of Thanh et al. (2011) by operationalizing the notion of "fairness given the difference" via counterfactual reasoning. ST finds for each complainant similar protected and non-protected instances in the dataset; constructs, respectively, a control and test group; and compares the groups such that a difference in model outcomes implies a potential case of individual discrimination. CST, instead, avoids this idealized comparison by establishing the test group on the complainant's generated counterfactual, which reflects how the protected attribute when changed influences other seemingly neutral attributes of the complainant. Under CST we test for discrimination for each complainant by comparing similar individuals within the control and test group but dissimilar individuals across these groups. We consider single (e.g.,~gender) and multidimensional (e.g.,~gender and race) discrimination testing. For multidimensional discrimination we study multiple and intersectional discrimination and, as feared by legal scholars, find evidence that the former fails to account for the latter kind. Using a k-nearest neighbor implementation, we showcase CST on synthetic and real data. Experimental results show that CST uncovers a higher number of cases than ST, even when the model is counterfactually fair. CST, in fact, extends counterfactual fairness (CF) of Kusner et al. (2017) by equipping CF with confidence intervals, which we report for all experiments.</p></details> |
| **15** | **[Automatic Double Reinforcement Learning in Semiparametric Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06926v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Estimating long-term causal effects from short-term data is essential for decision-making in healthcare, economics, and industry, where long-term follow-up is often infeasible. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a principled framework for modeling outcomes as sequences of states, actions, and rewards over time. We introduce a semiparametric extension of Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for statistically efficient, model-robust inference on linear functionals of the Q-function, such as policy values, in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing semiparametric structure on the Q-function, our method relaxes the strong state overlap assumptions required by fully nonparametric approaches, improving efficiency and stability. To address computational and robustness challenges of minimax nuisance estimation, we develop a novel debiased plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which integrates fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression step. This procedure leverages the Q-function as a data-driven dimension reduction, debiases all linear functionals of interest simultaneously, and enables nonparametric inference without explicit nuisance function estimation. Bellman calibration generalizes isotonic calibration to MDPs and may be of independent interest for prediction in reinforcement learning. Finally, we show that model selection for the Q-function incurs only second-order bias and extend the adaptive debiased machine learning (ADML) framework to MDPs for data-driven learning of semiparametric structure.</p></details> |

This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive experiments show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods.</p></details> |

In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose SkewScore, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of SkewScore in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |

While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</p></details> |

However, SNPs often have weak effects on complex traits, leading to bias in existing MR analysis when weak instruments are included. In addition, existing MR methods often restrict analysis to independent SNPs via linkage disequilibrium clumping and result in a loss of efficiency in estimating the causal effect due to discarding correlated SNPs. To address these issues, we propose the Debiased Estimating Equation Method (DEEM), a summary statistics-based MR approach that can incorporate a large number of correlated, weak-effect, and invalid SNPs. DEEM effectively eliminates the weak instrument bias and improves the statistical efficiency of the causal effect estimation by leveraging information from a large number of correlated SNPs. DEEM also allows for pleiotropic effects, adjusts for the winner's curse, and applies to both two-sample and one-sample MR analyses. Asymptotic analyses of the DEEM estimator demonstrate its attractive theoretical properties. Through extensive simulations and two real data examples, we demonstrate that DEEM significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of MR analysis compared with existing methods.</p></details> |

Although humans are adept at understanding these properties by constructing 3D and temporal (4D) representations of the world, current video understanding models struggle to extract these dynamic semantics, arguably because these models use cross-frame reasoning without underlying knowledge of the 3D/4D scenes. In this work, we introduce DynSuperCLEVR, the first video question answering dataset that focuses on language understanding of the dynamic properties of 3D objects. We concentrate on three physical concepts -- velocity, acceleration, and collisions within 4D scenes. We further generate three types of questions, including factual queries, future predictions, and counterfactual reasoning that involve different aspects of reasoning about these 4D dynamic properties. To further demonstrate the importance of explicit scene representations in answering these 4D dynamics questions, we propose NS-4DPhysics, a Neural-Symbolic VideoQA model integrating Physics prior for 4D dynamic properties with explicit scene representation of videos. Instead of answering the questions directly from the video text input, our method first estimates the 4D world states with a 3D generative model powered by physical priors, and then uses neural symbolic reasoning to answer the questions based on the 4D world states. Our evaluation on all three types of questions in DynSuperCLEVR shows that previous video question answering models and large multimodal models struggle with questions about 4D dynamics, while our NS-4DPhysics significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. Our code and data are released in https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/DynSuperCLEVR/.</p></details> |

Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.</p></details> |

As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.</p></details> |

First, we derive model identifiability under the sublinear growth assumption. Then, we propose a novel method, named the Deconfounded Functional Structure Estimation (DeFuSE), consisting of a deconfounding adjustment to remove the confounding effects and a sequential procedure to estimate the causal order of variables. We implement DeFuSE via feedforward neural networks for scalable computation. Moreover, we establish the consistency of DeFuSE under an assumption called the strong causal minimality. In simulations, DeFuSE compares favorably against state-of-the-art competitors that ignore confounding or nonlinearity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed approach with an application to gene regulatory network analysis.

While deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spatial-temporal super-resolution tasks, their computationally intensive nature poses significant deployment challenges for resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in real-time mobile video processing scenarios where power efficiency and latency constraints coexist. In this work, we propose a Reparameterizable Architecture for High Fidelity Video Super Resolution method, named RepNet-VSR, for real-time 4x video super-resolution. On the REDS validation set, the proposed model achieves 27.79 dB PSNR when processing 180p to 720p frames in 103 ms per 10 frames on a MediaTek Dimensity NPU. The competition results demonstrate an excellent balance between restoration quality and deployment efficiency. The proposed method scores higher than the previous champion algorithm of MAI video super-resolution challenge.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Event-Enhanced Blurry Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13042v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR), aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and 7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/Ev-DeblurVSR.</p></details> |

While deep learning-based VSR methods achieve impressive results, their centralized nature raises serious privacy concerns, particularly in applications with strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers an alternative approach, but existing FL methods struggle with low-level vision tasks, leading to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this, we propose FedVSR1, a novel, architecture-independent, and stateless FL framework for VSR. Our approach introduces a lightweight loss term that improves local optimization and guides global aggregation with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at federated VSR. Extensive experiments show that FedVSR outperforms general FL methods by an average of 0.85 dB in PSNR, highlighting its effectiveness.

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p></details> |

While transformer-based VSR models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years, these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand, lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.</p></details> |

Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve--and even degrades--performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art in various metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

However, these techniques are less generalized in large-scale or complex scenarios, especially in satellite videos. In this paper, we propose to exploit the well-defined temporal difference for efficient and effective temporal compensation. To fully utilize the local and global temporal information within frames, we systematically modeled the short-term and long-term temporal discrepancies since we observed that these discrepancies offer distinct and mutually complementary properties. Specifically, we devise a Short-term Temporal Difference Module (S-TDM) to extract local motion representations from RGB difference maps between adjacent frames, which yields more clues for accurate texture representation. To explore the global dependency in the entire frame sequence, a Long-term Temporal Difference Module (L-TDM) is proposed, where the differences between forward and backward segments are incorporated and activated to guide the modulation of the temporal feature, leading to a holistic global compensation. Moreover, we further propose a Difference Compensation Unit (DCU) to enrich the interaction between the spatial distribution of the target frame and temporal compensated results, which helps maintain spatial consistency while refining the features to avoid misalignment. Rigorous objective and subjective evaluations conducted across five mainstream video satellites demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.

Leveraging multi modal prompts that combine textual and audio derived signals, DEEVISum incorporates Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) and Early Exit (EE) to strike a balance between performance and efficiency. MSKD offers a 1.33% absolute F1 improvement over baseline distillation (0.5%), while EE reduces inference time by approximately 21% with a 1.3 point drop in F1. Evaluated on the TVSum dataset, our best model PaLI Gemma2 3B + MSKD achieves an F1 score of 61.1, competing the performance of significantly larger models, all while maintaining a lower computational footprint.

It is an open and vendor neutral standard based on the extensible markup language XML. However, AutomationML extends XML with additional semantics, that limit the applicability of common XML-tools for applications like querying or data validation. This article provides practitioners with 1) an up-to-date ontology of the concepts in the AutomationML-standard, as well as 2) a declarative mapping to automatically transform any AutomationML model into RDF triples. Together, these artifacts allow practitioners an easy integration of AutomationML information into industrial knowledge graphs. A study on examples from the automation domain concludes that transforming AutomationML to OWL opens up new powerful ways for querying and validation that are impossible without transformation.</p></details> |

Existing DFKD methods focus primarily on improving image recognition performance on associated datasets, often neglecting the crucial aspect of the transferability of learned representations. In this paper, we propose Category-Aware Embedding Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (CAE-DFKD), which addresses at the embedding level the limitations of previous rely on image-level methods to improve model generalization but fail when directly applied to DFKD. The superiority and flexibility of CAE-DFKD are extensively evaluated, including: \textit{\textbf{i.)}} Significant efficiency advantages resulting from altering the generator training paradigm; \textit{\textbf{ii.)}} Competitive performance with existing DFKD state-of-the-art methods on image recognition tasks; \textit{\textbf{iii.)}} Remarkable transferability of data-free learned representations demonstrated in downstream tasks.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Enhancing New-item Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21362v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>New-items play a crucial role in recommender systems (RSs) for delivering fresh and engaging user experiences. However, traditional methods struggle to effectively recommend new-items due to their short exposure time and limited interaction records, especially in dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) where new-items get continuously introduced and users' preferences evolve over time. This leads to significant unfairness towards new-items, which could accumulate over the successive model updates, ultimately compromising the stability of the entire system. Therefore, we propose FairAgent, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based new-item fairness enhancement framework specifically designed for DRSs. It leverages knowledge distillation to extract collaborative signals from traditional models, retaining strong recommendation capabilities for old-items. In addition, FairAgent introduces a novel reward mechanism for recommendation tailored to the characteristics of DRSs, which consists of three components: 1) a new-item exploration reward to promote the exposure of dynamically introduced new-items, 2) a fairness reward to adapt to users' personalized fairness requirements for new-items, and 3) an accuracy reward which leverages users' dynamic feedback to enhance recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and backbone models demonstrate the superior performance of FairAgent. The results present that FairAgent can effectively boost new-item exposure, achieve personalized new-item fairness, while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[How to Backdoor the Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21323v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Knowledge distillation has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning systems, celebrated for its ability to transfer knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a more efficient student model. Traditionally, this process is regarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from conventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor triggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation process. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher model to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response to backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically poisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with backdoor triggers. This technique allows for the stealthy compromise of the student model while maintaining the integrity of the teacher model. Our innovative approach represents the first successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the knowledge distillation process using clean teacher models. Through extensive experiments conducted across various datasets and attack settings, we demonstrate the robustness, stealthiness, and effectiveness of our method. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and pave the way for future research aimed at securing knowledge distillation processes against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |

However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.</p></details> |

While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention. We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees. Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients' data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.</p></details> |

To address the technical challenges in plant disease recognition, including small-sample learning, leaf occlusion, illumination variations, and high inter-class similarity, this study innovatively proposes a Dynamic Dual-Stream Fusion Network (DS_FusionNet). The network integrates a dual-backbone architecture, deformable dynamic fusion modules, and bidirectional knowledge distillation strategy, significantly enhancing recognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that DS_FusionNet achieves classification accuracies exceeding 90% using only 10% of the PlantDisease and CIFAR-10 datasets, while maintaining 85% accuracy on the complex PlantWild dataset, exhibiting exceptional generalization capabilities. This research not only provides novel technical insights for fine-grained image classification but also establishes a robust foundation for precise identification and management of agricultural diseases.</p></details> |

However, due to limitations in existing training methods and inherent model constraints, SNNs often exhibit a performance gap when compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored as a technique to transfer knowledge from ANN teacher models to SNN student models to mitigate this gap. Traditional KD methods typically use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to align output distributions. However, conventional KL-based approaches fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs, as they tend to overemphasize high-probability predictions while neglecting low-probability ones, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address this, we propose Head-Tail Aware Kullback-Leibler (HTA-KL) divergence, a novel KD method for SNNs. HTA-KL introduces a cumulative probability-based mask to dynamically distinguish between high- and low-probability regions. It assigns adaptive weights to ensure balanced knowledge transfer, enhancing the overall performance. By integrating forward KL (FKL) and reverse KL (RKL) divergence, our method effectively align both head and tail regions of the distribution. We evaluate our methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Our method outperforms existing methods on most datasets with fewer timesteps.</p></details> |

With the advent of cutting-edge technologies, keeping up with rapid changes are becoming increasingly challenging. In addition to that, increasing dependencies on the cloud technologies have imposed enormous pressure on modern web browsers leading to adapting new technologies faster and making them more susceptible to defects/bugs. Although, many studies have explored browser bugs, a comparative study among the modern browsers generalizing the bug categories and their nature was still lacking. To fill this gap, we undertook an empirical investigation aimed at gaining insights into the prevalent bugs in Google Chromium and Mozilla Firefox as the representatives of modern web browsers. We used GPT-4.o to identify the defect (bugs) categories and analyze the clusters of the most commonly appeared bugs in the two prominent web browsers. Additionally, we compared our LLM based bug categorization with the traditional NLP based approach using TF-IDF and K-Means clustering. We found that although Google Chromium and Firefox have evolved together since almost around the same time (2006-2008), Firefox suffers from high number of bugs having extremely high defect-prone components compared to Chromium. This exploratory study offers valuable insights on the browser bugs and defect-prone components to the developers, enabling them to craft web browsers and web-applications with enhanced resilience and reduced errors.</p></details> |

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</p></details> |

KB-VQA introduces unique challenges, including the alignment of heterogeneous information from diverse modalities and sources, the retrieval of relevant knowledge from noisy or large-scale repositories, and the execution of complex reasoning to infer answers from the combined context. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), KB-VQA systems have also undergone a notable transformation, where LLMs serve as powerful knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented generators and strong reasoners. Despite substantial progress, no comprehensive survey currently exists that systematically organizes and reviews the existing KB-VQA methods. This survey aims to fill this gap by establishing a structured taxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, and categorizing the systems into main stages: knowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning.

However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains, indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.</p></details> |

However, the existing MMKGs are significantly fewer than required, and their construction faces numerous challenges, particularly in ensuring the selection of high-quality, contextually relevant images for knowledge graph enrichment. To address these challenges, we present a framework for constructing MMKGs from conventional KGs. Furthermore, to generate higher-quality images that are more relevant to the context in the given knowledge graph, we designed a neighbor selection method called Visualizable Structural Neighbor Selection (VSNS). This method consists of two modules: Visualizable Neighbor Selection (VNS) and Structural Neighbor Selection (SNS). The VNS module filters relations that are difficult to visualize, while the SNS module selects neighbors that most effectively capture the structural characteristics of the entity. To evaluate the quality of the generated images, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations on two datasets, MKG-Y and DB15K. The experimental results indicate that using the VSNS method to select neighbors results in higher-quality images that are more relevant to the knowledge graph.</p></details> |

Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.</p></details> |

When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.</p></details> |
| **17** | **[Coding-Prior Guided Diffusion Network for Video Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12222v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>While recent video deblurring methods have advanced significantly, they often overlook two valuable prior information: (1) motion vectors (MVs) and coding residuals (CRs) from video codecs, which provide efficient inter-frame alignment cues, and (2) the rich real-world knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion generative models. We present CPGDNet, a novel two-stage framework that effectively leverages both coding priors and generative diffusion priors for high-quality deblurring. First, our coding-prior feature propagation (CPFP) module utilizes MVs for efficient frame alignment and CRs to generate attention masks, addressing motion inaccuracies and texture variations. Second, a coding-prior controlled generation (CPC) module network integrates coding priors into a pretrained diffusion model, guiding it to enhance critical regions and synthesize realistic details. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with up to 30% improvement in IQA metrics. Both the code and the codingprior-augmented dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |

We start by introducing three critical dimensions to characterize mutual understanding: sharing knowledge, exchanging knowledge, and governing knowledge. Sharing knowledge involves aligning the conceptual models of different agents to enable a shared understanding of the domain of interest. Exchanging knowledge relates to ensuring the effective and accurate communication between agents. Governing knowledge concerns establishing rules and processes to regulate the interaction between agents. Then, we present several different use case scenarios that demonstrate the application of NeSy AI and Knowledge Graphs to aid meaningful exchanges between human, artificial, and robotic agents. These scenarios highlight both the potential and the challenges of combining top-down symbolic reasoning with bottom-up neural learning, guiding the discussion of the coverage provided by current solutions along the dimensions of sharing, exchanging, and governing knowledge. Concurrently, this analysis facilitates the identification of gaps and less developed aspects in mutual understanding to address in future research.</p></details> |

The thesis then advances a top-down solution approach to the above stratified problem of representation heterogeneity in terms of several solution components, namely: (i) a representation formalism stratified into concept level, language level, knowledge level and data level to accommodate representation heterogeneity, (ii) a top-down language representation using Universal Knowledge Core (UKC), UKC namespaces and domain languages to tackle the conceptual and language level heterogeneity, (iii) a top-down knowledge representation using the notions of language teleontology and knowledge teleontology to tackle the knowledge level heterogeneity, (iv) the usage and further development of the existing LiveKnowledge catalog for enforcing iterative reuse and sharing of language and knowledge representations, and, (v) the kTelos methodology integrating the solution components above to iteratively generate the language and knowledge representations absolving representation heterogeneity. The thesis also includes proof-of-concepts of the language and knowledge representations developed for two international research projects - DataScientia (data catalogs) and JIDEP (materials modelling). Finally, the thesis concludes with future lines of research.</p></details> |

However, spatial intelligence spans a broader range of disciplines and scales, from navigation and urban planning to remote sensing and earth science. What are the differences and connections between spatial intelligence across these fields? In this paper, we first review human spatial cognition and its implications for spatial intelligence in LLMs. We then examine spatial memory, knowledge representations, and abstract reasoning in LLMs, highlighting their roles and connections. Finally, we analyze spatial intelligence across scales -- from embodied to urban and global levels -- following a framework that progresses from spatial memory and understanding to spatial reasoning and intelligence. Through this survey, we aim to provide insights into interdisciplinary spatial intelligence research and inspire future studies.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[HeteRAG: A Heterogeneous Retrieval-augmented Generation Framework with Decoupled Knowledge Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10529v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods can enhance the performance of LLMs by incorporating retrieved knowledge chunks into the generation process. In general, the retrieval and generation steps usually have different requirements for these knowledge chunks. The retrieval step benefits from comprehensive information to improve retrieval accuracy, whereas excessively long chunks may introduce redundant contextual information, thereby diminishing both the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. However, existing RAG methods typically employ identical representations of knowledge chunks for both retrieval and generation, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous RAG framework (\myname) that decouples the representations of knowledge chunks for retrieval and generation, thereby enhancing the LLMs in both effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, we utilize short chunks to represent knowledge to adapt the generation step and utilize the corresponding chunk with its contextual information from multi-granular views to enhance retrieval accuracy. We further introduce an adaptive prompt tuning method for the retrieval model to adapt the heterogeneous retrieval augmented generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \myname achieves significant improvements compared to baselines.</p></details> |
| **22** | **[Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task, capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations. Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-source prompt transfer.</p></details> |
| **23** | **[Knowledge Graph Completion with Relation-Aware Anchor Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06129v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Text-based knowledge graph completion methods take advantage of pre-trained language models (PLM) to enhance intrinsic semantic connections of raw triplets with detailed text descriptions. Typical methods in this branch map an input query (textual descriptions associated with an entity and a relation) and its candidate entities into feature vectors, respectively, and then maximize the probability of valid triples. These methods are gaining promising performance and increasing attention for the rapid development of large language models. According to the property of the language models, the more related and specific context information the input query provides, the more discriminative the resultant embedding will be. In this paper, through observation and validation, we find a neglected fact that the relation-aware neighbors of the head entities in queries could act as effective contexts for more precise link prediction. Driven by this finding, we propose a relation-aware anchor enhanced knowledge graph completion method (RAA-KGC). Specifically, in our method, to provide a reference of what might the target entity be like, we first generate anchor entities within the relation-aware neighborhood of the head entity. Then, by pulling the query embedding towards the neighborhoods of the anchors, it is tuned to be more discriminative for target entity matching. The results of our extensive experiments not only validate the efficacy of RAA-KGC but also reveal that by integrating our relation-aware anchor enhancement strategy, the performance of current leading methods can be notably enhanced without substantial modifications.</p></details> |
| **24** | **[Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05050v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |
| **25** | **[Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p></details> |

However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p></details> |

Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well. An implementation of the SpTransX framework is publicly available as a Python package in https://github.com/HipGraph/SpTransX.</p></details> |

This paper introduces the information theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM fine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways: minimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI to enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To apply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained deep learning framework, which was initially developed for image classification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM fine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the KD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's adaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing its potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning. Our work bridges the gap between information theory and LLM development, offering new insights for building high-performing language models.</p></details> |

Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.</p></details> |
| **31** | **[Partial Knowledge Distillation for Alleviating the Inherent Inter-Class Discrepancy in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15403v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Substantial efforts have been devoted to alleviating the impact of the long-tailed class distribution in federated learning. In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon that certain weak classes consistently exist even for class-balanced learning. These weak classes, different from the minority classes in the previous works, are inherent to data and remain fairly consistent for various network structures, learning paradigms, and data partitioning methods. The inherent inter-class accuracy discrepancy can reach over 36.9% for federated learning on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, even when the class distribution is balanced both globally and locally. In this study, we empirically analyze the potential reason for this phenomenon. Furthermore, a partial knowledge distillation (PKD) method is proposed to improve the model's classification accuracy for weak classes. In this approach, knowledge transfer is initiated upon the occurrence of specific misclassifications within certain weak classes. Experimental results show that the accuracy of weak classes can be improved by 10.7%, reducing the inherent inter-class discrepancy effectively.</p></details> |

Existing embedding-based methods rely solely on triples in the KG, which is vulnerable to specious relation patterns and long-tail entities. On the other hand, text-based methods struggle with the semantic gap between KG triples and natural language. Apart from triples, entity contexts (e.g., labels, descriptions, aliases) also play a significant role in augmenting KGs. To address these limitations, we propose KGR3, a context-enriched framework for KGC. KGR3 is composed of three modules. Firstly, the Retrieval module gathers supporting triples from the KG, collects plausible candidate answers from a base embedding model, and retrieves context for each related entity. Then, the Reasoning module employs a large language model to generate potential answers for each query triple. Finally, the Re-ranking module combines candidate answers from the two modules mentioned above, and fine-tunes an LLM to provide the best answer. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that KGR3 consistently improves various KGC methods. Specifically, the best variant of KGR3 achieves absolute Hits@1 improvements of 12.3% and 5.6% on the FB15k237 and WN18RR datasets.</p></details> |

Intra-domain discrimination focuses on individual nuances (i.e., clothing type, accessories, etc.), while inter-domain gaps emphasize domain consistency. Achieving a trade-off between maximizing intra-domain discrimination and minimizing inter-domain gaps is a crucial challenge for improving LReID performance. Most existing methods strive to reduce inter-domain gaps through knowledge distillation to maintain domain consistency. However, they often ignore intra-domain discrimination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain consistency representation learning (DCR) model that explores global and attribute-wise representations as a bridge to balance intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps. At the intra-domain level, we explore the complementary relationship between global and attribute-wise representations to improve discrimination among similar identities. Excessive learning intra-domain discrimination can lead to catastrophic forgetting. We further develop an attribute-oriented anti-forgetting (AF) strategy that explores attribute-wise representations to enhance inter-domain consistency, and propose a knowledge consolidation (KC) strategy to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DCR model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LReID methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DCR.</p></details> |

This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> |

Extensional knowledge provides information about the concrete instances that belong to specific concepts in the ontology, while intensional knowledge details inherent properties, characteristics, and semantic associations among concepts. However, existing ontology embedding approaches fail to take both extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge into fine consideration simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the domain.</p></details> |

This capability benefits various downstream information retrieval (IR) tasks. The primary challenge lies in enabling models to generalize effectively to unseen relation categories. Existing approaches typically leverage the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to accomplish the generalization process. However, these methods focus solely on fitting the training data during training, without specifically improving the model's generalization performance, resulting in limited generalization capability. For this reason, we explore the integration of bi-level optimization (BLO) with pre-trained language models for learning generalized knowledge directly from the training data, and propose a generative meta-learning framework which exploits the `learning-to-learn' ability of meta-learning to boost the generalization capability of generative models. Specifically, we introduce a BLO approach that simultaneously addresses data fitting and generalization. This is achieved by constructing an upper-level loss to focus on generalization and a lower-level loss to ensure accurate data fitting. Building on this, we subsequently develop three generative meta-learning methods, each tailored to a distinct category of meta-learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework performs well on the ZeroRTE task. Our code is available at https://github.com/leeworry/TGM-MetaLearning.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Computational and Algebraic Structure of Board Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01850v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We provide two methodologies in the area of computation theory to solve optimal strategies for board games such as Xi Gua Qi and Go. From experimental results, we find relevance to graph theory, matrix representation, and mathematical consciousness. We prove that the decision strategy of movement for Xi Gua Qi and Chinese checker games belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group over set Y={-1,0,1}. Additionally, the movement for any board game with two players belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group from the razor of Occam. We derive the closed form of the transition matrix for any board game with two players such as chess and Chinese chess. We discover that the element of the transition matrix belongs to a rational number. We propose a different methodology based on algebra theory to analyze the complexity of board games in their entirety, instead of being limited solely to endgame results. It is probable that similar decision processes of people may also belong to a matrix representation that is neither a ring nor a group.</p></details> |

While virtual reality (VR) is promising for older adults to socialize remotely, existing social VR designs primarily focus on verbal communication (e.g., reminiscent, chat). Actively engaging in shared activities is also an important aspect of social connection. We designed RemoteChess, which constructs a social community and a culturally relevant activity (i.e., Chinese chess) for older adults to play while engaging in social interaction. We conducted a user study with groups of older adults interacting with each other through RemoteChess. Our findings indicate that RemoteChess enhanced participants' social connectedness by offering familiar environments, culturally relevant social catalysts, and asymmetric interactions. We further discussed design guidelines for designing culturally relevant social activities in VR to promote social connectedness for older adults.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Temperatures of Robin Hood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07239v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Cumulative Games were introduced by Larsson, Meir, and Zick (2020) to bridge some conceptual and technical gaps between Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) and Economic Game Theory. The partizan ruleset {\sc Robin Hood} is an instance of a Cumulative Game, viz., {\sc Wealth Nim}. It is played on multiple heaps, each associated with a pair of cumulations, interpreted here as wealth. Each player chooses one of the heaps, removes tokens from that heap not exceeding their own wealth, while simultaneously diminishing the other player's wealth by the same amount. In CGT, the {\em temperature} of a {\em disjunctive sum} game component is an estimate of the urgency of moving first in that component. It turns out that most of the positions of {\sc Robin Hood} are {\em hot}. The temperature of {\sc Robin Hood} on a single large heap shows a dichotomy in behavior depending on the ratio of the wealths of the players. Interestingly, this bifurcation is related to Pingala (Fibonacci) sequences and the Golden Ratio $\phi$: when the ratio of the wealths lies in the interval $(\phi^{-1},\phi)$, the temperature increases linearly with the heap size, and otherwise it remains constant, and the mean values has a reciprocal property. It turns out that despite {\sc Robin Hood} displaying high temperatures, playing in the hottest component might be a sub-optimal strategy.</p></details> |

(''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Complete Implementation of WXF Chinese Chess Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17334v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Unlike repetitions in Western Chess where all repetitions are draws, repetitions in Chinese Chess could result in a win, draw, or loss depending on the kind of repetition being made by both players. One of the biggest hurdles facing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging games correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF rules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce several novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without compromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and we saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an increased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Maker-Breaker on Galton-Watson trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08334v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider the following combinatorial two-player game: On the random tree arising from a branching process, each round one player (Breaker) deletes an edge and by that removes the descendant and all its progeny, while the other (Maker) fixates an edge to permanently secure it from deletion. Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Relationship between misère NIM and two-player GOISHI HIROI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03996v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In combinatorial game theory, there are two famous winning conventions, normal play and mis\`ere play. Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[The Game Value of Sequential Compounds of Integers and Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08611v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. One of the major approaches to analyzing games in combinatorial game theory is to break down a given game position into a disjunctive sum of multiple sub-positions, then evaluate the game value of each component of the sum, and finally integrate these game values to find which player has a winning strategy in the whole position. Accordingly, finding the game value of a given position is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. The sequential compound proposed by Stromquist and Ullman is a combinatorial game consisting of two combinatorial games. In the sequential compound of games $G$ and $H$, the players make moves on $G$ until $G$ is over, and then they play on $H$. In this paper, we investigate the general properties of sequential compounds. As the main result, we give the game values of sequential compounds of a finite number of integers and stars, which are basic and typical games in combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(k log n), and this time complexity is on a par with the existing O(k log n) algorithm. We do not have any recursion overhead or stack overflow because we do not use any recursion. Therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1), and ours is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm in this respect. When k is small and n is large, our algorithm is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm. This new algorithm is based on a relation between the Josephus problem and a maximum Nim of combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[Mastering Chinese Chess AI (Xiangqi) Without Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04865v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We have developed a high-performance Chinese Chess AI that operates without reliance on search algorithms. This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1\% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold. The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p></details> |
| **11** | **[An Efficient Multi-Robot Arm Coordination Strategy for Pick-and-Place Tasks using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13511v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We introduce a novel strategy for multi-robot sorting of waste objects using Reinforcement Learning. Our focus lies on finding optimal picking strategies that facilitate an effective coordination of a multi-robot system, subject to maximizing the waste removal potential. We realize this by formulating the sorting problem as an OpenAI gym environment and training a neural network with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The objective function is set up to optimize the picking rate of the robotic system. In simulation, we draw a performance comparison to an intuitive combinatorial game theory-based approach. We show that the trained policies outperform the latter and achieve up to 16% higher picking rates. Finally, the respective algorithms are validated on a hardware setup consisting of a two-robot sorting station able to process incoming waste objects through pick-and-place operations.</p></details> |
| **12** | **[XQSV: A Structurally Variable Network to Imitate Human Play in Xiangqi](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04678v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an innovative deep learning architecture, termed Xiangqi Structurally Variable (XQSV), designed to emulate the behavioral patterns of human players in Xiangqi, or Chinese Chess. The unique attribute of XQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically, optimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on which it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to significantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local illegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional input, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations reveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its performance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's success in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific range. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV model imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi engines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the inherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic Xiangqi players.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[Degrees are Useless in SNORT When Measuring Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02107v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Snort is a two-player game played on a simple graph in which players alternately colour a vertex such that they do not colour adjacent to their opponents' vertex. In combinatorial game theory, the temperature of a position is a measure of the urgency of moving first. It is known that the temperature of \snort in general is infinite ($K_{1,n}$ has temperature $n$). We show that the temperature in addition can be infinitely larger than the degree of the board being played on. We do so by constructing a family of positions in which the temperature grows twice as fast as the degree of the board.</p></details> |
| **14** | **[Shogi and Frieze group](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08591v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Shogi is a traditional Japanese strategy board game in the same family as chess, chaturanga, and xiangqi, and has been theoretically studied from various aspects. The research on recommended sequences of moves in each opening of shogi is called joseki; how to use a rook (Static Rook and Ranging Rook), or how to develop a castle, etc. Also, many pieces of tsume shogi, artistic shogi miniature problems, in which the opponent's king is checkmated by a series of checks, have been created involving various beautiful techniques such as "saw" and "puzzle ring". In addition, the rapid development of AI in recent years has led to the pursuit of the best possible moves in shogi. In this paper, we move away from the study of winning and losing in shogi and focus on the mathematical aspects of the movement of shogi pieces. We propose to correspond movements of shogi pieces to a set of geometrical patterns constructed by the shape of shogi pieces and representing the Frieze group through the condition regarding the neighborhood of arrangements of given shogi pieces. Although the discovery of this correspondence does not lead to a winning strategy for shogi, however, it does demonstrate a curious involvement between the traditional Japanese board game and Western mathematics.</p></details> |

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

"JieQi"), a variation of Chinese chess. Dark Chinese chess combines some of the most complicated aspects of board and card games, such as long-term strategy or planning, large state space, stochastic, and imperfect-information, which make it closer to the real world decision-making problem and pose great challenges to game AI. Here we design a self-play program to calculate the game tree complexity and average information set size of the game, and propose an algorithm to calculate the number of information sets.</p></details> |

First, we propose an n-tuple network to extract features, since n-tuple networks require very little expert knowledge through its large numbers of features, while simulta-neously allowing easy access. Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT. Experiments show that with the same features and the same Chinese chess program, the automatically tuned comparison training feature weights achieved a win rate of 86.58% against the weights that were hand-tuned. The above trained version was then improved by adding additional features, most importantly n-tuple features. This improved version achieved a win rate of 81.65% against the trained version without additional features.</p></details> |

In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel. This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p></details> |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[ClarifyCoder: Clarification-Aware Fine-Tuning for Programmatic Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16331v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, a significant gap remains between their current performance and that of expert software engineers. A key differentiator is that human engineers actively seek clarification when faced with ambiguous requirements, while LLMs typically generate code regardless of uncertainties in the problem description. We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify ambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation. While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments existing programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements. We further provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for a joint optimization of both clarify-awareness and coding ability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClarifyCoder significantly improves the communication capabilities of Code LLMs through meaningful clarification dialogues while maintaining code generation capabilities.</p></details> |

However, incorporating external information into LLMs' code generation process introduces new security risks. In this paper, we reveal a real-world threat, named HACKODE, where attackers exploit referenced external information to embed attack sequences, causing LLMs to produce code with vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and incomplete validations. We designed a prototype of the attack, which generates effective attack sequences for potential diverse inputs with various user queries and prompt templates. Through the evaluation on two general LLMs and two code LLMs, we demonstrate that the attack is effective, achieving an 84.29% success rate. Additionally, on a real-world application, HACKODE achieves 75.92% ASR, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p></details> |

By curating LeetCode Python problems with rich metadata, broad coverage, 100+ test cases per problem, and temporal splits (pre/post July 2024), our dataset enables contamination-free evaluation and efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experiments show reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning counterparts, while SFT with only 2.6K model-generated solutions achieves performance comparable to 110K-sample counterparts.

| **6** | **[Risk Assessment Framework for Code LLMs via Leveraging Internal States](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3696630.3728566)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The pre-training paradigm plays a key role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been recognized as one of the most significant advancements of AI recently. Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with advanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering, showing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines. However, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to trustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code. Recent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky outputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain unconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are limited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving industry-level scalability and practicability. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code LLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing infrastructure of software companies. The core idea is that the risk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to LLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM states. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level risk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different programming languages. Further experiments also reveal that PtTrust provides highly intuitive and interpretable features, fostering greater user trust. We believe PtTrust makes a promising step toward scalable and trustworthy assurance for code LLMs.</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Less is More: Towards Green Code Large Language Models via Unified Structural Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15921v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The extensive application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative coding tasks has raised concerns due to their high computational demands and energy consumption. Unlike previous structural pruning methods designed for classification models that deal with lowdimensional classification logits, generative Code LLMs produce high-dimensional token logit sequences, making traditional pruning objectives inherently limited. Moreover, existing single component pruning approaches further constrain the effectiveness when applied to generative Code LLMs. In response, we propose Flab-Pruner, an innovative unified structural pruning method that combines vocabulary, layer, and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) pruning. This approach effectively reduces model parameters while maintaining performance. Additionally, we introduce a customized code instruction data strategy for coding tasks to enhance the performance recovery efficiency of the pruned model. Through extensive evaluations on three state-of-the-art Code LLMs across multiple generative coding tasks, the results demonstrate that Flab-Pruner retains 97% of the original performance after pruning 22% of the parameters and achieves the same or even better performance after post-training. The pruned models exhibit significant improvements in storage, GPU usage, computational efficiency, and environmental impact, while maintaining well robustness. Our research provides a sustainable solution for green software engineering and promotes the efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world generative coding intelligence applications.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Retrieval-Enhanced Few-Shot Prompting for Speech Event Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21372v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) is a challenging task that lies at the intersection of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), requiring the identification of structured event information from spoken language. In this work, we present a modular, pipeline-based SpeechEE framework that integrates high-performance ASR with semantic search-enhanced prompting of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system first classifies speech segments likely to contain events using a hybrid filtering mechanism including rule-based, BERT-based, and LLM-based models. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting, dynamically enriched via semantic similarity retrieval, to identify event triggers and extract corresponding arguments. We evaluate the pipeline using multiple LLMs (Llama3-8B, GPT-4o-mini, and o1-mini) highlighting significant performance gains with o1-mini, which achieves 63.3% F1 on trigger classification and 27.8% F1 on argument classification, outperforming prior benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that pipeline approaches, when empowered by retrieval-augmented LLMs, can rival or exceed end-to-end systems while maintaining interpretability and modularity. This work provides practical insights into LLM-driven event extraction and opens pathways for future hybrid models combining textual and acoustic features.</p></details> |

Many human-being applications are conducted daily via NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation. Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.</p></details> |

We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio.</p></details> |

Unlike conventional captioning systems that offer only plain text, our system fuses real-time speech recognition with affective and visual signal interpretation, including facial movements, gestures, and vocal tone, to produce emotionally enriched captions. These enhanced captions are rendered in an AR interface developed with Unity and provide contextual annotations such as speaker tone markers (e.g., "concerned") and gesture indicators (e.g., "nods"). The system leverages live camera and microphone input, processed through AI models to detect multimodal cues. Findings from preliminary evaluations suggest that this AR-based captioning approach significantly enhances comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to standard captions. Our work emphasizes the potential of immersive environments for inclusive, emotion-aware educational accessibility.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Multi-Task Corrupted Prediction for Learning Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18539v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption. Our code is available at https://github.com/sungnyun/cav2vec.</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.</p></details> |

To reduce the complexity of computations within the multi-head self-attention mechanism in Transformer, Selective State Space Models (i.e., Mamba) were proposed as an alternative. Mamba exhibited its effectiveness in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but its superiority has rarely been investigated in speech signal processing. This paper explores solutions for applying Mamba to speech processing by discussing two typical speech processing tasks: speech recognition, which requires semantic and sequential information, and speech enhancement, which focuses primarily on sequential patterns. The experimental results confirm that bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) consistently outperforms vanilla Mamba, highlighting the advantages of a bidirectional design for speech processing. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiMamba as an alternative to the self-attention module in the Transformer model and its derivates, particularly for the semantic-aware task. The crucial technologies for transferring Mamba to speech are then summarized in ablation studies and the discussion section, offering insights for extending this research to a broader scope of tasks.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Self-Supervised Monocular Visual Drone Model Identification through Improved Occlusion Handling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21695v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Ego-motion estimation is vital for drones when flying in GPS-denied environments. Vision-based methods struggle when flight speed increases and close-by objects lead to difficult visual conditions with considerable motion blur and large occlusions. To tackle this, vision is typically complemented by state estimation filters that combine a drone model with inertial measurements. However, these drone models are currently learned in a supervised manner with ground-truth data from external motion capture systems, limiting scalability to different environments and drones. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme to train a neural-network-based drone model using only onboard monocular video and flight controller data (IMU and motor feedback). We achieve this by first training a self-supervised relative pose estimation model, which then serves as a teacher for the drone model. To allow this to work at high speed close to obstacles, we propose an improved occlusion handling method for training self-supervised pose estimation models. Due to this method, the root mean squared error of resulting odometry estimates is reduced by an average of 15%. Moreover, the student neural drone model can be successfully obtained from the onboard data. It even becomes more accurate at higher speeds compared to its teacher, the self-supervised vision-based model. We demonstrate the value of the neural drone model by integrating it into a traditional filter-based VIO system (ROVIO), resulting in superior odometry accuracy on aggressive 3D racing trajectories near obstacles. Self-supervised learning of ego-motion estimation represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between flying in controlled, expensive lab environments and real-world drone applications. The fusion of vision and drone models will enable higher-speed flight and improve state estimation, on any drone in any environment.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Dance Style Recognition Using Laban Movement Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21166v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |

However, previous research studied these human-centric tasks individually, whose performance is largely limited to the size of the public task-specific datasets. Recent human-centric methods leverage the additional modalities, e.g., depth, to learn fine-grained semantic information, which limits the benefit of pretraining models due to their sensitivity to camera views and the scarcity of RGB-D data on the Internet. This paper improves the data scalability of human-centric pretraining methods by discarding depth information and exploring semantic information of RGB images in the frequency space by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We further propose new annotation denoising auxiliary tasks with keypoints and DCT maps to enforce the RGB image extractor to learn fine-grained semantic information of human bodies. Our extensive experiments show that when pretrained on large-scale datasets (COCO and AIC datasets) without depth annotation, our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods by +0.5 mAP on COCO, +1.4 PCKh on MPII and -0.51 EPE on Human3.6M for pose estimation, by +4.50 mIoU on Human3.6M for human parsing, by -3.14 MAE on SHA and -0.07 MAE on SHB for crowd counting, by +1.1 F1 score on SHA and +0.8 F1 score on SHA for crowd localization, and by +0.1 mAP on Market1501 and +0.8 mAP on MSMT for person ReID. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on MPII+NTURGBD datasets</p></details> |
| **4** | **[A Survey on Event-based Optical Marker Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20736v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The advent of event-based cameras, with their low latency, high dynamic range, and reduced power consumption, marked a significant change in robotic vision and machine perception. In particular, the combination of these neuromorphic sensors with widely-available passive or active optical markers (e.g. AprilTags, arrays of blinking LEDs), has recently opened up a wide field of possibilities. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on Event-Based Optical Marker Systems (EBOMS). We analyze the basic principles and technologies on which these systems are based, with a special focus on their asynchronous operation and robustness against adverse lighting conditions. We also describe the most relevant applications of EBOMS, including object detection and tracking, pose estimation, and optical communication. The article concludes with a discussion of possible future research directions in this rapidly-emerging and multidisciplinary field.</p></details> |

These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |

Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.</p></details> |

The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> |

Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.

The dataset offers over 833 minutes (3.7M+ images) of recordings that feature 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects. In addition to simple pick-up, observe, and put-down actions, the subjects perform actions typical for a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The recordings include multiple synchronized data streams containing egocentric multi-view RGB/monochrome images, eye gaze signal, scene point clouds, and 3D poses of cameras, hands, and objects. The dataset is recorded with two headsets from Meta: Project Aria, which is a research prototype of AI glasses, and Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset that has shipped millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats, and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, model-based 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.</p></details> |

However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.</p></details> |

However, the complexity of the system, such as non-convex and non-differentiable cost functions and prolonged planning horizons often drastically increases the computation time, limiting MPC's real-world applicability. Prior works in speeding up the optimization have limitations on optimizing MPC running time directly and generalizing to hold out domains. To overcome this challenge, we develop a novel framework aiming at expediting optimization processes directly. In our framework, we combine offline self-supervised learning and online fine-tuning to improve the control performance and reduce optimization time. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel and challenging Formula 1 track driving task. Comparing to single-phase training, our approach achieves a 19.4\% reduction in optimization time and a 6.3\% improvement in tracking accuracy on zero-shot tracks.</p></details> |

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

We propose a method where additional actuators are combined with a feedback-linearizing outer loop controller, enabling full-pose tracking without modifying the platform's certified low-level controller. The key contribution is a theoretical framework establishing conditions under which legacy high-level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. These conditions are validated through numerical simulations on a quadrotor retrofitted with two additional propellers. The results demonstrate stable 6D trajectory tracking, highlighting the method's ability to reconcile enhanced dexterity with industrial constraints such as certification and safety.</p></details> |

In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.</p></details> |

Building on the performance of the WINCLIP framework, we aim to enhance the system's localization capabilities by integrating zero-shot segmentation models. In addition, we perform foreground instance segmentation which enables the model to focus on the relevant parts of the image, thus allowing the models to better identify small or subtle deviations. Our pipeline requires no external data or information, allowing for it to be directly applied to new datasets.

For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.</p></details> |

A visual system that can estimate and track the complete garment pose can be useful for many downstream tasks and real-world applications. In this work, we present a complete package to address the category-level garment pose tracking task: (1) A recording system VR-Garment, with which users can manipulate virtual garment models in simulation through a VR interface. (2) A large-scale dataset VR-Folding, with complex garment pose configurations in manipulation like flattening and folding. (3) An end-to-end online tracking framework GarmentTracking, which predicts complete garment pose both in canonical space and task space given a point cloud sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GarmentTracking achieves great performance even when the garment has large non-rigid deformation. It outperforms the baseline approach on both speed and accuracy. We hope our proposed solution can serve as a platform for future research.

Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.</p></details> |

Specifically, we formulate the challenge to adapt an average TTS model to the stylistic target voice with limited data from target speaker, evaluated by speaker identity and style similarity. The challenge consists of two tracks, namely few-shot track and one-shot track, where the participants are required to clone multiple target voices with 100 and 5 samples respectively. There are also two sub-tracks in each track. For sub-track a, to fairly compare different strategies, the participants are allowed to use only the training data provided by the organizer strictly. For sub-track b, the participants are allowed to use any data publicly available.

However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |

However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</p></details> |

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .</p></details> |

To tackle the human geometry lacking in one RGB image, current methods typically resort to a preceding model for an explicit geometric representation. For the reconstruction itself, focus is on modeling both it and the input image. This routine is constrained by the preceding model, and overlooks the integrity of the reconstruction task. To address this, this paper introduces a novel paradigm that treats human reconstruction as a holistic process, utilizing an end-to-end network for direct prediction from 2D image to 3D avatar, eliminating any explicit intermediate geometry display. Based on this, we further propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of two core components: the Anatomy Shaping Extraction module, which captures implicit shape features taking into account the specialty of human anatomy, and the Twins Negotiating Reconstruction U-Net, which enhances reconstruction through feature interaction between two U-Nets of different modalities. Moreover, we propose a Comic Data Augmentation strategy and construct 15k+ 3D human scans to bolster model performance in more complex case input. Extensive experiments on two test sets and many in-the-wild cases show the superiority of our method over SOTA methods. Our demos can be found in : https://e2e3dgsrecon.github.io/e2e3dgsrecon/.</p></details> |

However, we observe that RGB images often lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity for geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases associated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled dual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key idea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture parts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the Principle of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with geometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as exclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the network's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm to introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB images as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust capabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction, single-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in Chamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.</p></details> |

Current text-to-3D generation methods typically combine parametric head models with 2D diffusion models using score distillation sampling to produce 3D-consistent results. However, they struggle to synthesize realistic details and suffer from misalignments between the appearance and the driving parametric model, resulting in unnatural animation results. We discovered that these limitations stem from ambiguities in the 2D diffusion predictions during 3D avatar distillation, specifically: i) the avatar's appearance and geometry is underconstrained by the text input, and ii) the semantic alignment between the predictions and the parametric head model is insufficient because the diffusion model alone cannot incorporate information from the parametric model. In this work, we propose a novel framework, AnimPortrait3D, for text-based realistic animatable 3DGS avatar generation with morphable model alignment, and introduce two key strategies to address these challenges. First, we tackle appearance and geometry ambiguities by utilizing prior information from a pretrained text-to-3D model to initialize a 3D avatar with robust appearance, geometry, and rigging relationships to the morphable model. Second, we refine the initial 3D avatar for dynamic expressions using a ControlNet that is conditioned on semantic and normal maps of the morphable model to ensure accurate alignment. As a result, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of synthesis quality, alignment, and animation fidelity. Our experiments show that the proposed method advances the state of the art in text-based, animatable 3D head avatar generation.</p></details> |

With limited high-quality training data and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent 4D sequences only given 2D images.</p></details> |

However, several challenges remain. In practical applications, users often provide extremely simple text inputs while expecting high-quality 3D content. Generating optimal results from such minimal text is a difficult task due to the strong dependency of text-to-3D models on the quality of input prompts. Moreover, the generation process exhibits high variability, making it difficult to control. Consequently, multiple iterations are typically required to produce content that meets user expectations, reducing generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose GPT-4V for self-optimization, which significantly enhances the efficiency of generating satisfactory content in a single attempt. Furthermore, the controllability of text-to-3D generation methods has not been fully explored. Our approach enables users to not only provide textual descriptions but also specify additional conditions, such as style, edges, scribbles, poses, or combinations of multiple conditions, allowing for more precise control over the generated 3D content. Additionally, during training, we effectively integrate multi-view information, including multi-view depth, masks, features, and images, to address the common Janus problem in 3D content generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization, facilitating the efficient and controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.</p></details> |

To address data scarcity, we propose an end-to-end system for synthetic data generation for scalable, high-quality, and customizable 3D indoor scenes. By integrating and adapting text-to-image and multi-view diffusion models with Neural Radiance Field-based meshing, this system generates highfidelity 3D object assets from text prompts and incorporates them into pre-defined floor plans using a rendering tool. By introducing novel loss functions and training strategies into existing methods, the system supports on-demand scene generation, aiming to alleviate the scarcity of current available data, generally manually crafted by artists. This system advances the role of synthetic data in addressing machine learning training limitations, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications.</p></details> |

We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization. As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.</p></details> |

And the approaches and advantages of memory-efficient data formats and storage techniques for such datasets vary. OpenVDB library and its VDB data format excels in memory efficiency through its hierarchical and dynamic tree structure, with active and inactive sub-trees for data storage. It is heavily used in current production renderers for both animation and rendering stages in VFX pipelines and photorealistic rendering of volumes and fluids. However, it still remains to be fully leveraged in SciVis where domains dealing with sparse scalar fields like porous media, time varying volumes such as tornado and weather simulation or high resolution simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics present ample number of large challenging data sets. The goal of this paper hence is not only to explore the use of OpenVDB in SciVis but also to explore a level of detail(LOD) technique using 3D Gaussian particles approximating voxel regions. For rendering, we utilize NVIDIA OptiX library for ray marching through the Gaussians particles. Data modeling using 3D Gaussians has been very popular lately due to success in stereoscopic image to 3D scene conversion using Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian approximation and mixture models aren't entirely new in SciVis as well. Our work explores the integration with rendering software libraries like OpenVDB and OptiX to take advantage of their built-in memory compaction and hardware acceleration features, while also leveraging the performance capabilities of modern GPUs. Thus, we present a SciVis rendering approach that uses 3D Gaussians at varying LOD in a lossy scheme derived from VDB datasets, rather than focusing on photorealistic volume rendering.</p></details> |

However, existing works still struggle to maintain consistency between the generated views and the input views, especially when there is a significant camera pose difference, leading to poor-quality 3D geometries and textures. We attribute this issue to their treatment of all target views with equal priority according to our empirical observation that the target views closer to the input views exhibit higher fidelity. With this inspiration, we propose AR-1-to-3, a novel next-view prediction paradigm based on diffusion models that first generates views close to the input views, which are then utilized as contextual information to progressively synthesize farther views. To encode the generated view subsequences as local and global conditions for the next-view prediction, we accordingly develop a stacked local feature encoding strategy (Stacked-LE) and an LSTM-based global feature encoding strategy (LSTM-GE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency between the generated views and the input views, producing high-fidelity 3D assets.</p></details> |

However, current methods usually focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D objects, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter settings at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for procedural 3D models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural models. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to generate texture for the shape produced by one setting of the procedural parameters, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other parameter settings. We also develop several techniques, including a novel UV displacement network for real-time texture transfer, the retexturing pipeline to support structural changes from discrete procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of professional procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting real-time, interactive applications.</p></details> |

We use a pointmap-based geometric representation to coordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We construct a predictable distribution of geometric features per target view to enable learnability across examples, and generalization to arbitrary inputs images. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to novel-view synthesis (called "unPIC") beats competing baselines such as CAT3D, EscherNet, Free3D, and One-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as unseen real-world objects from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, and the Digital Twin Catalog.</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p></details> |

Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a robust text-to-texture method for generating consistent and seamless textures that are well aligned with the mesh. Our method leverages state-of-the-art 2D diffusion models, including SDXL and multiple ControlNets, to capture structural features and intricate details in the generated textures. The method also employs a symmetrical view synthesis strategy combined with regional prompts for enhancing view consistency. Additionally, it introduces novel texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques, which significantly reduce the seam regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

However, applying these models to synthesize textures for 3D geometries remains challenging due to the domain gap between 2D images and textures on a 3D surface. Early works that used a projecting-and-inpainting approach managed to preserve generation diversity but often resulted in noticeable artifacts and style inconsistencies. While recent methods have attempted to address these inconsistencies, they often introduce other issues, such as blurring, over-saturation, or over-smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel text-to-texture synthesis framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models. We first introduce a local attention reweighing mechanism in the self-attention layers to guide the model in concentrating on spatial-correlated patches across different views, thereby enhancing local details while preserving cross-view consistency. Additionally, we propose a novel latent space merge pipeline, which further ensures consistency across different viewpoints without sacrificing too much diversity. Our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques regarding texture consistency and visual quality, while delivering results much faster than distillation-based methods. Importantly, our framework does not require additional training or fine-tuning, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of models available on public platforms.</p></details> |

With a novel architecture and sampling procedure, we enable training on a mixture of 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data, which greatly improves generalization to unseen images and camera pose trajectories over prior works that focus on limited domains (e.g., object centric). 4DiM is the first-ever NVS method with intuitive metric-scale camera pose control enabled by our novel calibration pipeline for structure-from-motion-posed data. Experiments demonstrate that 4DiM outperforms prior 3D NVS models both in terms of image fidelity and pose alignment, while also enabling the generation of scene dynamics. 4DiM provides a general framework for a variety of tasks including single-image-to-3D, two-image-to-video (interpolation and extrapolation), and pose-conditioned video-to-video translation, which we illustrate qualitatively on a variety of scenes.

Our proposed approach allows users to generate 3D textured clothes based on both real and synthetic images, such as those generated by text prompts. The generated assets can be directly draped and simulated on human bodies. We leverage the recent progress of image-to-3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. Carefully designed losses allow the base mesh to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and topology such that they can be simulated. Finally, we generate high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated 3D assets. With Garment3DGen users can generate the simulation-ready 3D garment of their choice without the need of artist intervention. We present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various assets and demonstrate that Garment3DGen unlocks key applications ranging from sketch-to-simulated garments or interacting with the garments in VR. Code is publicly available.</p></details> |

We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</p></details> |

However, generating diverse customized images with reference visual attributes remains challenging. This work focuses on personalizing T2I diffusion models at a more abstract concept or category level, adapting commonalities from a set of reference images while creating new instances with sufficient variations. We introduce a solution that allows a pretrained T2I diffusion model to learn a set of soft prompts, enabling the generation of novel images by sampling prompts from the learned distribution. These prompts offer text-guided editing capabilities and additional flexibility in controlling variation and mixing between multiple distributions. We also show the adaptability of the learned prompt distribution to other tasks, such as text-to-3D. Finally we demonstrate effectiveness of our approach through quantitative analysis including automatic evaluation and human assessment.

Formal verification of these systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception DNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for autonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based Modeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of scenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2) Probabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction of perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that represents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and Acceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of the autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations of environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth autonomous car using LiDAR observations.</p></details> |

For specification, they cannot express algorithms naturally and concisely, especially for algorithms with states and flexible control flow. For verification, formal proof based on Hoare logic cannot reflect the logical structure of natural proof. To address these challenges, we introduce a formal framework for naturally specifying and verifying sequential algorithms in Coq. We use the state relation monad to integrate Coq's expressive type system with the flexible control flow of imperative languages. It supports nondeterministic operations and customizable program states, enabling specifying algorithms at an appropriate level of abstraction. For verification, we build a Hoare logic for the monad and propose a novel two-stage proof approach that separates natural logical reasoning from mechanical composition. It reflects the logical structure of natural proof, enhancing modularity and readability. We evaluate the framework by formalizing the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and verifying the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.</p></details> |

One such redundancy is goal cloning, i.e., proving {\alpha}-equivalent goals multiple times, leading to wasted effort and bloated proof scripts. In this paper, we introduce clone-finder, a novel technique for detecting goal clones in Rocq proofs. By leveraging the formal notion of {\alpha}-equivalence for Gallina terms, clone-finder systematically identifies duplicated proof goals across large Rocq codebases. We evaluate clone-finder on 40 real-world Rocq projects from the CoqGym dataset. Our results reveal that each project contains an average of 27.73 instances of goal clone. We observed that the clones can be categorized as either exact goal duplication, generalization, or {\alpha}-equivalent goals with different proofs, each signifying varying levels duplicate effort. Our findings highlight significant untapped potential for proof reuse in Rocq-based formal verification projects, paving the way for future improvements in automated proof engineering.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[SynFuzz: Leveraging Fuzzing of Netlist to Detect Synthesis Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18812v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit (IC) design, the increasing complexity of modern processors and intellectual property (IP) cores has introduced new challenges in ensuring design correctness and security. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing techniques have shown their efficacy in detecting hardware bugs and vulnerabilities at the RTL abstraction level of hardware. However, they suffer from several limitations, including an inability to address vulnerabilities introduced during synthesis and gate-level transformations. These methods often fail to detect issues arising from library adversaries, where compromised or malicious library components can introduce backdoors or unintended behaviors into the design. In this paper, we present a novel hardware fuzzer, SynFuzz, designed to overcome the limitations of existing hardware fuzzing frameworks. SynFuzz focuses on fuzzing hardware at the gate-level netlist to identify synthesis bugs and vulnerabilities that arise during the transition from RTL to the gate-level. We analyze the intrinsic hardware behaviors using coverage metrics specifically tailored for the gate-level. Furthermore, SynFuzz implements differential fuzzing to uncover bugs associated with EDA libraries. We evaluated SynFuzz on popular open-source processors and IP designs, successfully identifying 7 new synthesis bugs. Additionally, by exploiting the optimization settings of EDA tools, we performed a compromised library mapping attack (CLiMA), creating a malicious version of hardware designs that remains undetectable by traditional verification methods. We also demonstrate how SynFuzz overcomes the limitations of the industry-standard formal verification tool, Cadence Conformal, providing a more robust and comprehensive approach to hardware verification.</p></details> |

While adversarial robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only between different models but also across categories within the same task and between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to compare and select models based on application-specific robustness requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for real-world deployment.</p></details> |

However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.</p></details> |

Concretely, we define two canonical functors from the category of first-order theories to the category of their models, and then introduce a canonical natural transformation that links the Henkin-based term models to semantically constructed models arising from compactness or saturation arguments. We prove that every component of this natural transformation is an isomorphism, thereby establishing a strong equivalence between the syntactic and semantic perspectives. Furthermore, we show that this transformation is 2-categorically rigid: any other natural transformation in the same setting is uniquely isomorphic to it. Our framework highlights the shared diagonalization principle underlying both Henkin's and Lawvere's methods and demonstrates concrete applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the design of advanced type-theoretic systems.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Automated Discovery of Tactic Libraries for Interactive Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24036v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Enabling more concise and modular proofs is essential for advancing formal reasoning using interactive theorem provers (ITPs). Since many ITPs, such as Rocq and Lean, use tactic-style proofs, learning higher-level custom tactics is crucial for proof modularity and automation. This paper presents a novel approach to tactic discovery, which leverages Tactic Dependence Graphs (TDGs) to identify reusable proof strategies across multiple proofs. TDGs capture logical dependencies between tactic applications while abstracting away irrelevant syntactic details, allowing for both the discovery of new tactics and the refactoring of existing proofs into more modular forms. We have implemented this technique in a tool called TacMiner and compare it against an anti-unification-based approach Peano to tactic discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that TacMiner can learn 3x as many tactics as Peano and reduces the size of proofs by 26% across all benchmarks. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of learning custom tactics for proof automation, allowing a state-of-the-art proof automation tool to achieve a relative increase of 172% in terms of success rate.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[A Natural Transformation between the Model Constructions of the Completeness and Compactness Theorems, Enhanced by Rigidity and 2-Categorical Strengthening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16555v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper we present a mathematically rigorous and constructive framework that unifies two canonical model constructions in classical first order logic. In particular, we define two functors F and G from the category of consistent first order theories to the category of models. The functor F is constructed via the Henkin method, which extends any given theory to a maximal consistent theory by means of a fixed enumeration and the systematic introduction of Henkin constants, and then constructs a term model by taking the quotient of the term algebra with respect to provable equality. The functor G is obtained through a canonical compactness based construction, using either a fixed ultraproduct or a saturation procedure, ensuring that the resulting model is unique up to isomorphism. We prove the existence of a natural transformation eta from F to G such that each component is an isomorphism. Moreover, by leveraging the uniqueness of saturated (or prime) models in countable languages, we show that eta is rigid, meaning any other natural transformation between F and G must equal eta. Furthermore, we establish a strong natural equivalence between F and G in the two categorical sense, with eta and its inverse satisfying the required coherence conditions. This unification not only deepens our understanding of the interplay between proof theory and model theory, but also opens new avenues for applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the study of alternative logical systems.</p></details> |
| **11** | **[Local Look-Ahead Guidance via Verifier-in-the-Loop for Automated Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09730v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the model, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human annotated trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |

This paper presents a recipe for the simultaneous deployment of different forms of deep and shallow embeddings in classical higher-order logic, enabling not only flexible interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, but also automated faithfulness proofs between the logic embeddings. The approach, which is fruitful for logic education, research and application, is deliberately illustrated here using simple propositional modal logic. However, the work presented is conceptual in nature and not limited to such a simple logic context.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof Progress Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17925v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.</p></details> |

A key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, which we address through the following approaches. First, we train LLMs to convert natural language math problems from the Numina dataset to equivalent formal statements in Lean 4. This process creates the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1, which includes 1.64 million formal statements. Next, we develop a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each new prover can prove many statements that previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. Finally, we obtain the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1-solved, which contains proofs for over 800K statements from Goedel-Pset-v1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base on Goedel-Pset-v1-solved (i.e., no RL) yields a Goedel-Prover-SFT that achieves a success rate of 57.6% (Pass@32) on miniF2F, surpassing the previous leader DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL (trained using SFT + RL on a proprietary dataset) by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover-SFT successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. We provide extensive discussion of our training methodology, highlighting the key design choices that contribute to Goedel-Prover's strong performance. Further RL training (including DPO) improves Goedel-Prover-SFT's success rate to over 60% (Pass@32) on miniF2F. To aid future research, we provide extensive discussion of our training methodology and design choices. We also fully open-source our codes, models, and datasets. Additionally, we open-source formal proofs for 29.7K problems in Lean Workbook, nearly doubling the 15.7K solved by prior provers.</p></details> |

Previously, APPS provided a benchmark and dataset for programming puzzles to be completed in Python and checked against unit tests, of the kind seen in technical assessments in the software engineering industry. Building upon recent approaches for benchmarks in interactive theorem proving, we generalize the unit tests to Lean 4 theorems given without proof (i.e., using Lean's "sorry" keyword). On the 406 theorems of 100 randomly selected samples, Sonnet correctly proves 30% and Gemini correctly proves 18%. We challenge the machine learning and program synthesis communities to solve both each general purpose programming problem and its associated correctness specifications.

Specifically, it achieves a pass of 68.4% on the miniF2F-test compared to 65.9%, the current SOTA results. It proves 4 IMO statements (imo_1960_p2, imo_1962_p2}, imo_1964_p2 and imo_1983_p6) in miniF2F-test.

As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.</p></details> |

Deriving the most appropriate subsequent proof step, and reasoning about it, given the multitude of possibilities, remains a daunting task for novice users. To improve the situation, several investigations have developed machine learning based guidance for tactic selection. Such approaches struggle to learn non-trivial relationships between the chosen tactic and the structure of the proof state and represent them as symbolic expressions. To address these issues we (i) We represent the problem as an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) task, (ii) Using the ILP representation we enriched the feature space by encoding additional, computationally expensive properties as background knowledge predicates, (iii) We use this enriched feature space to learn rules explaining when a tactic is applicable to a given proof state, (iv) we use the learned rules to filter the output of an existing tactic selection approach and empirically show improvement over the non-filtering approaches.</p></details> |

Design-level verification tools ensure software specifications are correct, but they do not expose defects in actual implementations. For this purpose, engineers use code-level tools. However, such tools struggle to scale to large software. The process of "Unit Proofing" mitigates this by decomposing the software and verifying each unit independently. We examined AWS's use of unit proofing and observed that current approaches are manual and prone to faults that mask severe defects. We propose a research agenda for a unit proofing framework, both methods and tools, to support software engineers in applying unit proofing effectively and efficiently. This will enable engineers to discover code-level defects early.</p></details> |

In practice, it is mainly used for interactive theorem proving with intensional type theories, with PVS being a notable exception. In this paper, we present native rules for automated reasoning in a dependently-typed version (DHOL) of classical higher-order logic (HOL). DHOL has an extensional type theory with an undecidable type checking problem which contains theorem proving. We implemented the inference rules as well as an automatic type checking mode in Lash, a fork of Satallax, the leading tableaux-based prover for HOL. Our method is sound and complete with respect to provability in DHOL. Completeness is guaranteed by the incorporation of a sound and complete translation from DHOL to HOL recently proposed by Rothgang et al. While this translation can already be used as a preprocessing step to any HOL prover, to achieve better performance, our system directly works in DHOL. Moreover, experimental results show that the DHOL version of Lash can outperform all major HOL provers executed on the translation.</p></details> |

Research in the area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often complex and difficult to replicate. Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for fair and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP. We demonstrate BAIT's capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding. We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT will be a springboard for future research.</p></details> |
| **23** | **[Trocq: Proof Transfer for Free, With or Without Univalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14022v2)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Libraries of formalized mathematics use a possibly broad range of different representations for a same mathematical concept. Yet light to major manual input from users remains most often required for obtaining the corresponding variants of theorems, when such obvious replacements are typically left implicit on paper. This article presents Trocq, a new proof transfer framework for dependent type theory. Trocq is based on a novel formulation of type equivalence, used to generalize the univalent parametricity translation. This framework takes care of avoiding dependency on the axiom of univalence when possible, and may be used with more relations than just equivalences. We have implemented a corresponding plugin for the Coq proof assistant, in the CoqElpi meta-language. We use this plugin on a gallery of representative examples of proof transfer issues in interactive theorem proving, and illustrate how Trocq covers the spectrum of several existing tools, used in program verification as well as in formalized mathematics in the broad sense.</p></details> |

Traditionally, symbolic methods that rely on extensive domain knowledge and engineering effort are applied to this task. In contrast, this work demonstrates that contrastive training with the transformer architecture can achieve higher-quality retrieval of relevant premises, without the engineering overhead. Our method, Magnushammer, outperforms the most advanced and widely used automation tool in interactive theorem proving called Sledgehammer. On the PISA and miniF2F benchmarks Magnushammer achieves $59.5\%$ (against $38.3\%$) and $34.0\%$ (against $20.9\%$) success rates, respectively. By combining \method with a language-model-based automated theorem prover, we further improve the state-of-the-art proof success rate from $57.0\%$ to $71.0\%$ on the PISA benchmark using $4$x fewer parameters. Moreover, we develop and open source a novel dataset for premise selection, containing textual representations of (proof state, relevant premise) pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available premise selection dataset, and the first one for the Isabelle proof assistant.</p></details> |
