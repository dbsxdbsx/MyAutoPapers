| **1** | **[Can David Beat Goliath? On Multi-Hop Reasoning with Resource-Constrained Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21699v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Reuse your FLOPs: Scaling RL on Hard Problems by Conditioning on Very Off-Policy Prefixes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18795v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Efficient Self-Learning and Model Versioning for AI-native O-RAN Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17534v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The AI-native vision of 6G requires Radio Access Networks to train, deploy, and continuously refine thousands of machine learning (ML) models that drive real-time radio network optimization. Although the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture provides open interfaces and an intelligent control plane, it leaves the life-cycle management of these models unspecified. Consequently, operators still rely on ad-hoc, manual update practices that can neither scale across the heterogeneous, multi-layer stack of Cell-Site, Edge-, Regional-, and Central-Cloud domains, nor across the three O-RAN control loops (real-, near-real-, and non-real-time). We present a self-learning framework that provides an efficient closed-loop version management for an AI-native O-RAN edge. In this framework, training pipelines in the Central/Regional Cloud continuously generate new models, which are cataloged along with their resource footprints, security scores, and accuracy metrics in a shared version repository. An Update Manager consults this repository and applies a self-learning policy to decide when and where each new model version should be promoted into operation. A container orchestrator then realizes these decisions across heterogeneous worker nodes, enabling multiple services (rApps, xApps, and dApps) to obtain improved inference with minimal disruption. Simulation results show that an efficient RL-driven decision-making can guarantee quality of service, bounded latencies while balancing model accuracy, system stability, and resilience.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Miner:Mining Intrinsic Mastery for Data-Efficient RL in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04731v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Evaluating Parameter Efficient Methods for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23165v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[$π_\texttt{RL}$: Online RL Fine-tuning for Flow-based Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25889v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying RL to large-scale flow-based VLAs (\eg, $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods raised from flow matching. We address this challenge with $π_{\texttt{RL}}$, featuring two technical approaches: (1) \textbf{Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) \textbf{Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration. We evaluate $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ across various benchmarks, with experiments demonstrating that RL yields significant performance improvements in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15965v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving $1.07\times-2.43\times$ speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Constrained MDPs with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10138v4)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Online Risk-Averse Planning in POMDPs Using Iterated CVaR Value Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20554v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Structural Monotonicity in Transmission Scheduling for Remote State Estimation with Hidden Channel Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19131v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Toward Learning POMDPs Beyond Full-Rank Actions and State Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18930v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02547v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Unveiling the Black Box: A Multi-Layer Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning-Based Cyber Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11708v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque, hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker agents that reveals both strategic (Markov Decision Process (MDP)-level) and tactical (policy-level) reasoning. At the MDP-level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy-level, we analyse the temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences. Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike previous explainable RL methods, which are {predominantly} post-hoc, domain-specific, or limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic, {supporting use cases such as red-team simulation, RL policy debugging, phase-aware threat modelling and anticipatory defence planning.} By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence, our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate, analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Near-Optimal Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Partial Online State Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08762v4)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general framework for sequential decision-making under latent state uncertainty, yet learning in POMDPs is intractable in the worst case. Motivated by sensing and probing constraints in practice, we study how much online state information (OSI) is sufficient to enable efficient learning guarantees. We formalize a model in which the learner can query only partial OSI (POSI) during interaction. We first prove an information-theoretic hardness result showing that, for general POMDPs, achieving an $ε$-optimal policy can require sample complexity that is exponential unless full OSI is available. We then identify two structured subclasses that remain learnable under POSI and propose corresponding algorithms with provably efficient performance guarantees. In particular, we establish regret upper bounds with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ dependence on the number of episodes $K$, together with complementary lower bounds, thereby delineating when POSI suffices for efficient reinforcement learning. Our results highlight a principled separation between intractable and tractable regimes under incomplete online state access and provide new tools for jointly optimizing POSI queries and learning control actions.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[What Fundamental Structure in Reward Functions Enables Efficient Sparse-Reward Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03790v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) remains fundamentally hard: without structure, any agent needs $Ω(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|/p)$ samples to recover rewards. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) as a first concrete step toward a structural reward learning framework. Our key idea is to exploit approximate low-rank + sparse structure in the reward matrix, under policy-biased (MNAR) sampling. We prove recovery guarantees with inverse-propensity weighting, and establish a visitation-weighted error-to-regret bound linking completion error to control performance. Importantly, when assumptions weaken, PAMC degrades gracefully: confidence intervals widen and the algorithm abstains, ensuring safe fallback to exploration. Empirically, PAMC improves sample efficiency across Atari-26 (10M steps), DM Control, MetaWorld MT50, D4RL offline RL, and preference-based RL benchmarks, outperforming DrQ-v2, DreamerV3, Agent57, T-REX/D-REX, and PrefPPO under compute-normalized comparisons. Our results highlight PAMC as a practical and principled tool when structural rewards exist, and as a concrete first instantiation of a broader structural reward learning perspective.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[LLM-Driven Intrinsic Motivation for Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18420v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation towards goals.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[SuperRL: Reinforcement Learning with Supervision to Boost Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01096v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories, leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods. We introduce SuperRL, a unified training framework that adaptively alternates between RL and SFT. Whenever every rollout for a given instance receives zero reward, indicating the absence of a learning signal, SuperRL falls back to SFT on the curated offline data. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL surpasses vanilla RL by delivering higher sample efficiency, stronger generalization, and improved robustness under sparse rewards.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19850v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise, requiring efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment, and overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with superhuman ability. Prior work commonly explores with the objective of solving many sparse-reward tasks, making exploration of individual high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We argue that solving such challenging tasks requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task, i.e., whose achieval will teach the agent skills required for solving the target task. We demonstrate that this sense of direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without leveraging any prior information. To this end, we propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the space of all tasks. We then perform a thorough evaluation in high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[STAR-R1: Spatial TrAnsformation Reasoning by Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15804v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets. With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging. Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks. Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</p></details> |

In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |

Detecting Deception in Negotiations using Counterfactual RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12436v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.</p></details> |

In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few records are available for each patient, and patients may show different responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real (possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.</p></details> |

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.</p></details> |

However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.</p></details> |

While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Causal Inference in Biomedical Imaging via Functional Linear Structural Equation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20610v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Understanding the causal effects of organ-specific features from medical imaging on clinical outcomes is essential for biomedical research and patient care. We propose a novel Functional Linear Structural Equation Model (FLSEM) to capture the relationships among clinical outcomes, functional imaging exposures, and scalar covariates like genetics, sex, and age. Traditional methods struggle with the infinite-dimensional nature of exposures and complex covariates. Our FLSEM overcomes these challenges by establishing identifiable conditions using scalar instrumental variables. We develop the Functional Group Support Detection and Root Finding (FGS-DAR) algorithm for efficient variable selection, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, including selection consistency and accurate parameter estimation. We further propose a test statistic to test the nullity of the functional coefficient, establishing its null limit distribution. Our approach is validated through extensive simulations and applied to UK Biobank data, demonstrating robust performance in detecting causal relationships from medical imaging.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Exact Graph Learning via Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20589v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Learning the dependence structure among variables in complex systems is a central problem across medical, natural, and social sciences. These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes. GLIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated data and benchmark datasets across all aforementioned classes of graphs.</p></details> |

Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.</p></details> |

However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.</p></details> |

Counterfactual Generation for LLM-Based Autonomous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20090v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.</p></details> |

| **11** | **[GraIP: A Benchmarking Framework For Neural Graph Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18917v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.</p></details> |

This often yields dense weighted matrices that require arbitrary post-hoc thresholding to recover a DAG. This gap between continuous optimization and discrete graph structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing the Hybrid-Order Acyclicity Constraint (AHOC) and optimizing it via the Smoothed Proximal Gradient (SPG-AHOC). Leveraging the Manifold Identification Property of proximal algorithms, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee: the Finite-Time Oracle Property. We prove that under standard identifiability assumptions, SPG-AHOC recovers the exact DAG support (structure) in finite iterations, even when optimizing a smoothed approximation. This result eliminates structural ambiguity, as our algorithm returns graphs with exact zero entries without heuristic truncation. Empirically, SPG-AHOC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strongly corroborates the finite-time identification theory.</p></details> |

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.</p></details> |

An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.</p></details> |

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.</p></details> |

Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</p></details> |

This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |

While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases. Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual, and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive, counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.</p></details> |

Recent work has shown that sheaf-theoretic approaches offer a principled framework for representing and aligning causal knowledge across collections of subjective and imperfect causal models connected by relational structures. In this work, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a general sheaf-theoretic framework for representing, learning, and reasoning across collections of mixture causal models (MCMs). CAN formalizes causal abstraction relations among subjective MCMs operating at different levels of granularity, while remaining agnostic to explicit causal graphs, functional mechanisms, interventional data, or jointly sampled observations. At the theoretical level, we provide a categorical formulation of MCMs and characterize key properties of CANs, including consistency, smoothness, and the existence of global sections, which are related to spectral properties of an associated combinatorial Laplacian. At the methodological level, we address the problem of learning consistent CANs from data by exploiting the compositionality of causal abstractions and necessary conditions for their existence. The learning task decomposes into local problems on the network edges, for which we propose efficient solutions in Gaussian and Gaussian mixture settings. We validate the proposed learning methods on synthetic data and illustrate the practical relevance of the CAN framework through a financial application, demonstrating both recovery and counterfactual reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |

However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.</p></details> |

Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.</p></details> |

Since clusters serve as their own control, the CRXO design is typically more statistically efficient than the usual parallel-arm design. CRXO trials are increasingly popular in many areas of health research where the number of available clusters is limited. Further, in trials among severely ill patients, researchers often want to assess the effect of treatments on secondary non-terminal outcomes, but frequently in these studies, there are patients who do not survive to have these measurements fully recorded. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework and treatment effect estimation methods for addressing truncation by death in the setting of CRXO trials. We target the survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, a well-defined subgroup treatment effect obtained via principal stratification. We propose novel structural and standard modeling assumptions that enable estimating the SACE within a Bayesian paradigm. We evaluate the small-sample performance of our proposed Bayesian approach for estimation of the SACE in CRXO trial settings via simulation studies. We apply our methods to a previously conducted two-period cross-sectional CRXO study examining the impact of proton pump inhibitors compared to histamine-2 receptor blockers on length of hospitalization among adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.</p></details> |

Yet, conventional approaches based on fixed- or random-effects models lack a causal framework, which may limit their interpretability and utility for public policy. Incorporating causal inference reframes meta-analysis as the estimation of well-defined causal effects on clearly specified populations, enabling a principled approach to handling study heterogeneity. We show that classical meta-analysis estimators have a clear causal interpretation when effects are measured as risk differences. However, this breaks down for nonlinear measures like the risk ratio and odds ratio. To address this, we introduce novel causal aggregation formulas that remain compatible with standard meta-analysis practices and do not require access to individual-level data. To evaluate real-world impact, we apply both classical and causal meta-analysis methods to 500 published meta-analyses. While the conclusions often align, notable discrepancies emerge, revealing cases where conventional methods may suggest a treatment is beneficial when, under a causal lens, it is in fact harmful.</p></details> |

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based systems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby garnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several benchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by formalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-and-reasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with relevant retrieved news articles downloaded from the Web. However, because there is no consideration of whether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting rationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently noninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET, which comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for retrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability through causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected recent trend forecasting questions, and then filtered the data using CIL resulting in an inferable benchmark for future forecasting. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth investigations into future forecasting with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative prediction methods on PROPHET. The overall results draws valuable insights for task of future directions.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[OSDEnhancer: Taming Real-World Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with One-Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20308v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |

Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[HATIR: Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent Infrared Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04682v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Infrared video has been of great interest in visual tasks under challenging environments, but often suffers from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR. Project page: https://github.com/JZ0606/HATIR</p></details> |

Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods.

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.</p></details> |

This achievement is built upon several key components, including meticulous data curation, an advanced DiT architecture featuring selective and sliding tile attention (SSTA), enhanced bilingual understanding through glyph-aware text encoding, progressive pre-training and post-training, and an efficient video super-resolution network. Leveraging these designs, we developed a unified framework capable of high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation across multiple durations and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this compact and proficient model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source video generation models.

The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.</p></details> |

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data</p></details> |

Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Bridging Graph Structure and Knowledge-Guided Editing for Interpretable Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21978v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[OVD: On-policy Verbal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21968v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.</p></details> |

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components. Firstly, it mitigates cross-domain disparity transfer by adaptively integrating unlabeled data to equilibrate the informativeness of training signals across groups. Secondly, it redistributes cross-domain information gains via an information-theoretic approach to ensure equitable benefit allocation across groups. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and baselines demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces unfairness in CDR without sacrificing overall recommendation performance, while even enhancing it.</p></details> |

Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |

To this end, we developed an integrated computational pipeline leveraging knowledge graph, pathway analysis and network pharmacology to elucidate the multi-target mechanisms of Ayurvedic Single Herbal Drugs (SHDs). SHDs associated with diabetes and obesity were curated from the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, followed by phytochemical identification using IMPPAT database, yielding a shortlist of 11 SHDs and their 188 phytochemicals after drug-likeness and bioavailability filtering. Subsequently, molecular targets of the phytochemicals in SHDs, disease-associated genes and therapeutic targets of FDA-approved drugs, were curated via integration of data from several databases. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant functional overlap between SHD-associated and disease-associated pathways. All curated data were embedded into a Neo4j-based knowledge graph, enabling SHD-disease intersection analysis that prioritized key disease-relevant targets, including PTPN1, GLP1R, and DPP4. Also, the SHD-Target-FDA-approved drug profile elucidated the molecular and mechanistic aspects of the SHDs as a phytochemical cocktail, and is in alignment with the clinically studied synergistic FDA-approved drug combinations. Network pharmacology based protein-protein interaction analysis identified PPARG as another central regulator. Using a quantitative framework, we identified phytochemical pairs within SHDs, which were structurally dissimilar and target-wise distinct, yet acted on shared or different disease-associated pathways, indicating complementary and potentially synergistic interactions. Molecular docking analysis of two selected druggable targets identified putative lead phytochemicals.</p></details> |

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cyclexfy/PathReasoner-R1.</p></details> |

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Evaluated in offline experiments and online A/B tests on an e-commerce search advertising platform serving tens of millions of users daily, our method delivers significant offline gains, showing clear benefits in both commercial performance and user experience.</p></details> |

A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.</p></details> |

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.</p></details> |

The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge. To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access.</p></details> |

However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility.

This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.</p></details> |

Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents. All code and data are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/GraphAnchor.</p></details> |

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.</p></details> |

By capturing hierarchical component relationships, connections, and semantic elements across diverse engineering domains, our proposed dataset would enable multimodal large language models to address critical downstream tasks including structured diagram parsing, cross-modal information retrieval, and AI-assisted engineering simulation. Enginuity would be transformative for AI for Scientific Discovery by enabling artificial intelligence systems to comprehend and manipulate the visual-structural knowledge embedded in engineering diagrams, breaking down a fundamental barrier that currently prevents AI from fully participating in scientific workflows where diagram interpretation, technical drawing analysis, and visual reasoning are essential for hypothesis generation, experimental design, and discovery.</p></details> |

Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.</p></details> |

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data. First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics. Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation. Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability. Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.</p></details> |

However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |

However, the minimality requirement of stable models can be restrictive for applications requiring exploration of non-minimal but logically consistent solution spaces. Supported models, introduced by Apt, Blair, and Walker in 1988, relax this minimality constraint while maintaining a support condition ensuring every true atom is justified by some rule. Despite their theoretical significance, supported models lack practical computational tools integrated with modern ASP solvers. We present a novel transformation-based method enabling computation of supported models using standard ASP infrastructure. Our approach transforms any ground logic program into an equivalent program whose stable models correspond exactly to the supported models of the original program. We implement this transformation for Clingo, providing the first practical tool for computing supported models with state-of-the-art ASP solvers. We demonstrate applications in software verification, medical diagnosis, and planning where supported models enable valuable exploratory reasoning capabilities beyond those provided by stable models. We also provide an empirical evaluation to justify the practical utility of our approach compared to established methods. Our implementation is publicly available and compatible with standard ASP syntax.</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.</p></details> |

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.</p></details> |

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p></details> |

Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> |

Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images called \textbf{'RestoRect'}. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality, demonstrating superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 10 metrics against baselines.</p></details> |

While the continuous influx of new, unlabeled audio presents an opportunity to enrich these static representations, a naive approach is to retrain the model from scratch using all available data. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and discards the valuable knowledge embedded in the previously trained model weights. To address this inefficiency, we propose SONAR (Self-distilled cONtinual pre-training for domain adaptive Audio Representation), a continual pre-training framework built upon BEATs. SONAR effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by tackling three key challenges: implementing a joint sampling strategy for new and prior data, applying regularization to balance specificity and generality, and dynamically expanding the tokenizer codebook for novel acoustic patterns. Experiments across four distinct domains demonstrate that our method achieves both high adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting.</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning capabilities, their deployment in resource-constrained AEC environments is often impractical. Conversely, standard efficient models struggle with the significant domain gap. Although this gap can be mitigated by pre-training on large, humancurated corpora, such approaches are labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose ARCE (Augmented RoBERTa with Contextualized Elucidations), a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages LLMs to synthesize a task-oriented corpus, termed Cote, for incrementally pre-training smaller models. ARCE systematically explores the optimal strategy for knowledge transfer. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20% and outperforming both domain-specific baselines and fine-tuned LLMs. Crucially, our study reveals a less is more principle: simple, direct explanations prove significantly more effective for domain adaptation than complex, role-based rationales in the NER task, which tend to introduce semantic noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |

Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems, autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.</p></details> |

With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, leveraging these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation and enable annotation-free training has become a promising research direction. This paper studies learning from noisy partial labels generated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes a collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) framework. Unlike symmetric noise commonly assumed in traditional noisy label learning, VLM-generated noise is instance-dependent and reflects the intrinsic biases of pre-trained models, posing greater challenges. To address this issue, we jointly train two neural networks to perform collaborative label purification via a co-pseudo-labeling mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization in both label and feature representation spaces. In addition, multiple anti-overfitting strategies are introduced, including alternating optimization of contrastive representations and pseudo-labels, as well as maintaining class prototypes in a shared feature space. The proposed method can further incorporate few-shot manually annotated labels for performance enhancement. Extensive experiments under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of integrating weakly supervised learning into the knowledge distillation of pre-trained models.</p></details> |

Moreover, when deployed in a new domain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent retraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational overhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels based on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However, geographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous features at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises the reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive negative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and unsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge transfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture consists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain transfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop framework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is designed to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small amount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared feature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at initialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS employs dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while preserving consistency in a shared feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDIKTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under full supervision compared with those supervised methods, and further surpasses existing unsupervised methods in both few-shot and cross-domain initialization.</p></details> |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods provide external information, the lack of explicit organization among retrieved passages limits their effectiveness, leading to brittle reasoning pathways. Recent interpretability studies highlighting the importance of structured intermediate reasoning further align with this perspective. We propose Retrieval-And-Structuring (RAS), a framework that dynamically constructs question-specific knowledge graphs through iterative retrieval and structured knowledge building. RAS interleaves targeted retrieval planning with incremental graph construction, enabling models to assemble and reason over evolving knowledge structures tailored to each query. On seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks, RAS consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 8.7\% and 7.0\% gains with proprietary and open-source LLMs, respectively. Our results demonstrate that dynamic, question-specific knowledge structuring offers a robust path to improving reasoning accuracy and robustness in language model generation.</p></details> |

Inspired by this cognitive capability, we introduce a concept-centric multi-modality learning framework built around a modality-agnostic concept space that captures structured, abstract knowledge, alongside a set of modality-specific projection models that map raw inputs onto this shared space. The concept space is decoupled from any specific modality and serves as a repository of universally applicable knowledge. Once learned, the knowledge embedded in the concept space enables more efficient adaptation to new modalities, as projection models can align with existing conceptual representations rather than learning from scratch. This efficiency is empirically validated in our experiments, where the proposed framework exhibits faster convergence compared to baseline models. In addition, the framework's modular design supports seamless integration of new modalities, since projection models are trained independently yet produce unified outputs within the shared concept space. We evaluate the framework on two representative downstream tasks. While the focus is not on task-specific optimization, the framework attains comparable results with a smaller training footprint, no task-specific fine-tuning, and inference performed entirely within a shared space of learned concepts that offers interpretability. These findings point toward a promising direction for developing learning systems that operate in a manner more consistent with human cognitive processes.</p></details> |

In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> |

A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction.

(2025). Our approach provides automatic proofs that both confirm and extend their results, and the same techniques apply to newly introduced variants as well. Then, using classic techniques, we obtain new recursive and morphic characterizations of Wythoff-type games where the set of terminal positions $(x,y)$ satisfy $x+y\le\ell$. The use of Walnut in combinatorial game theory is relatively recent, and only a few examples have been explored so far. The Wythoff game, being directly connected to the Fibonacci numeration system, proves especially well-suited to this kind of approach. It permits us to solve instances for a fixed value of a parameter.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Impartial Games with Activeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20984v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. The main object of combinatorial game theory is to obtain the outcome, which player has a winning strategy, of a given combinatorial game. Positions of many well-known combinatorial games are naturally decomposed into a disjunctive sum of multiple components and can be analyzed independently for each component. Therefore, the study of disjunctive sums is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. Combinatorial games in which both players have the same set of possible moves for every position are called impartial games. In the normal-play convention, it is known that the outcome of a disjunctive sum of impartial games can be obtained by computing the Grundy number of each term. The theory of impartial games is generalized in various forms. This paper proposes another generalization of impartial games to a new framework, impartial games with activeness: each game is assigned a status of either ``active'' or ``inactive''; the status may change by moves; a disjunctive sum of games ends immediately, not only when no further moves can be made, but also when all terms become inactive. We formally introduce impartial games with activeness and investigate their fundamental properties.</p></details> |

In these rulesets, the sets of options of both players are the same. However, there are two kinds of terminal positions. If the game ends in one of the terminal positions, then a player wins and if the game ends in the other terminal position, the other player wins. We introduce notations for positions in $\mathcal{L}\mathcal{R}$-ending partisan rulesets and show their algebraic structures. We also introduce some examples of $\mathcal{L}\mathcal{R}$-partisan rulesets and show how our results can be used for analyzing the rulesets.</p></details> |

We introduce a unified diamond framework, the $\Diamond_A$-property ($A\in\{\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{D}$), for sets of positions closed under options. Under certain conditions, this framework guarantees that all values are integers, dyadic rationals, or pairs $\{m|n\}$ (on $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{D}$). As an application, we establish that every position in \textsc{Yashima} game on bipartite graphs has an integer pair value.</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in complex areas.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[On 3-terminal positions in Hex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08247v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper is about 3-terminal regions in Hex. A 3-terminal region is a region of the Hex board that is completely surrounded by black and white stones, in such a way that the black boundary stones form 3 connected components. We characterize Hex as the universal planar Shannon game of degree 3. This ensures that every Hex position can be decomposed into 3-terminal regions. We then investigate the combinatorial game theory of 3-terminal regions. We show that there are infinitely many distinct Hex-realizable values for such regions. We introduce an infinite family of 3-terminal positions called superswitches and investigate their properties. We also present a database of Hex-realizable 3-terminal values, and illustrate its utility as a problem-solving tool by giving various applications. The applications include the automated verification of connects-both templates and pivoting templates, a new handicap strategy for $11\times 11$ Hex, and a method for constructing witnesses for the non-inferiority of probes in many Hex templates. These methods allow us to disprove a conjecture by Henderson and Hayward.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[A number game reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04717v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Number games play a central role in alternating normal play combinatorial game theory due to their real-number-like properties (Conway 1976). Here we undertake a critical re-examination: we begin with integer and dyadic games and identify subtle inconsistencies and oversights in the established literature (e.g. Siegel 2013), most notably, the lack of distinction between a game being a number and a game being equal to a number. After addressing this, we move to the general theory of number games. We analyze Conway's original definition and a later refinement by Siegel, and highlight conceptual gaps that have largely gone unnoticed. Through a careful dissection of these issues, we propose a more coherent and robust formulation. Specifically, we develop a refined characterization of numbers, via several subclasses, dyadics, canonical forms, their group theoretic closure and zugzwangs, that altogether better capture the essence of number games. This reconciliation not only clarifies existing ambiguities but also uncovers several open problems.</p></details> |

Addressing the underexplored complexity of Xiangqi, including its unique board layout, piece movement constraints, and victory conditions, our approach combines policy-value networks with MCTS to simulate move consequences and refine decision-making. By overcoming challenges such as Xiangqi's high branching factor and asymmetrical piece dynamics, our work advances AI capabilities in culturally significant strategy games while providing insights for adapting DRL-MCTS frameworks to domain-specific rule systems.</p></details> |

From experimental results, we find relevance to graph theory, matrix representation, and mathematical consciousness. We prove that the decision strategy of movement for Xi Gua Qi and Chinese checker games belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group over set Y={-1,0,1}. Additionally, the movement for any board game with two players belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group from the razor of Occam. We derive the closed form of the transition matrix for any board game with two players such as chess and Chinese chess. We discover that the element of the transition matrix belongs to a rational number. We propose a different methodology based on algebra theory to analyze the complexity of board games in their entirety, instead of being limited solely to endgame results. It is probable that similar decision processes of people may also belong to a matrix representation that is neither a ring nor a group.</p></details> |

While virtual reality (VR) is promising for older adults to socialize remotely, existing social VR designs primarily focus on verbal communication (e.g., reminiscent, chat). Actively engaging in shared activities is also an important aspect of social connection. We designed RemoteChess, which constructs a social community and a culturally relevant activity (i.e., Chinese chess) for older adults to play while engaging in social interaction. We conducted a user study with groups of older adults interacting with each other through RemoteChess. Our findings indicate that RemoteChess enhanced participants' social connectedness by offering familiar environments, culturally relevant social catalysts, and asymmetric interactions. We further discussed design guidelines for designing culturally relevant social activities in VR to promote social connectedness for older adults.</p></details> |

One of the biggest hurdles facing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging games correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF rules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce several novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without compromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and we saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an increased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.</p></details> |

This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1\% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold. The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p></details> |

The unique attribute of XQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically, optimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on which it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to significantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local illegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional input, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations reveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its performance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's success in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific range. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV model imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi engines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the inherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic Xiangqi players.</p></details> |

The research on recommended sequences of moves in each opening of shogi is called joseki; how to use a rook (Static Rook and Ranging Rook), or how to develop a castle, etc. Also, many pieces of tsume shogi, artistic shogi miniature problems, in which the opponent's king is checkmated by a series of checks, have been created involving various beautiful techniques such as "saw" and "puzzle ring". In addition, the rapid development of AI in recent years has led to the pursuit of the best possible moves in shogi. In this paper, we move away from the study of winning and losing in shogi and focus on the mathematical aspects of the movement of shogi pieces. We propose to correspond movements of shogi pieces to a set of geometrical patterns constructed by the shape of shogi pieces and representing the Frieze group through the condition regarding the neighborhood of arrangements of given shogi pieces. Although the discovery of this correspondence does not lead to a winning strategy for shogi, however, it does demonstrate a curious involvement between the traditional Japanese board game and Western mathematics.</p></details> |

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

Dark Chinese chess combines some of the most complicated aspects of board and card games, such as long-term strategy or planning, large state space, stochastic, and imperfect-information, which make it closer to the real world decision-making problem and pose great challenges to game AI.

The aim of this work is to lay the foundations for bridging the conceptual and technical gaps between CGT and EGT, here interpreted as multiplayer Extensive Form Games, so that they can be treated within a unified framework. More specifically, we introduce a class of $n$-player, general-sum games, called {\sc Cumulative Games}, which can be analyzed using tools from both CGT and EGT. We show how two of the most fundamental definitions of CGT, the outcome function and the disjunctive sum operator, naturally extend to the class of {\sc Cumulative Games}. The outcome function allows for efficient equilibrium computation under certain restrictions, while the disjunctive sum operator lets us define a partial order over games according to the advantage that a given player has. Finally, we show that any Extensive Form Game can be written as a {\sc Cumulative Game}.</p></details> |

We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.</p></details> |

As CodeLLMs are being employed toward automating these tasks, one question that arises, especially in enterprise settings, is whether these coding assistants and the code LLMs that power them are ready for real-world projects and enterprise use cases, and how do they impact the existing software engineering process and user experience. In this paper we survey 57 developers from different domains and with varying software engineering skill about their experience with AI coding assistants and CodeLLMs. We also reviewed 35 user surveys on the usage, experience and expectations of professionals and students using AI coding assistants and CodeLLMs. Based on our study findings and analysis of existing surveys, we discuss the requirements for AI-powered coding assistants.</p></details> |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Evaluating and Achieving Controllable Code Completion in Code LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15879v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Code completion has become a central task, gaining significant attention with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based tools in software engineering. Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs' code completion and instruction-following capabilities, establishing new directions for future research in code LLMs. To facilitate reproducibility and foster further research in code LLMs, we open-source all code, datasets, and models.</p></details> |

Evaluating Code Understanding and Execution via Invertibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13398v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>LLMs demonstrate strong performance on code benchmarks, yet round-trip code execution reveals limitations in their ability to maintain consistent reasoning across forward and backward execution. We present RoundTripCodeEval (RTCE), a comprehensive benchmark consisting of four distinct code execution reasoning tasks designed to rigorously test round-trip consistency. RTCE provides an execution-free, exact-match evaluation of bijection fidelity, assessing whether models preserve a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations across various algorithms and directions. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks. We will release the code and the dataset upon acceptance.</p></details> |

Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10496v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.</p></details> |

However, current Code LLMs still rely heavily on real-world data, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we explore a fully synthetic approach: training Code LLMs with entirely generated tasks, solutions, and test cases, to empower code reasoning models without relying on real-world data. To support this, we leverage feature-based synthesis to propose a novel data synthesis pipeline called SynthSmith. SynthSmith shows strong potential in producing diverse and challenging tasks, along with verified solutions and tests, supporting both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Based on the proposed synthetic SFT and RL datasets, we introduce the X-Coder model series, which achieves a notable pass rate of 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B despite having only 7B parameters. In-depth analysis reveals that scaling laws hold on our synthetic dataset, and we explore which dimensions are more effective to scale. We further provide insights into code-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the key factors that shape performance through detailed ablations and analysis. Our findings demonstrate that scaling high-quality synthetic data and adopting staged training can greatly advance code reasoning, while mitigating reliance on real-world coding data.</p></details> |

Despite the promising performance, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, which means LLMs might produce outputs that deviate from users' intent, exhibit internal inconsistencies, or misaligned with the real-world knowledge, making the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in a wide range of applications. Existing work mainly focuses on investigating the hallucination in the domain of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leaving a gap in comprehensively understanding the types, causes, and impacts of hallucinations in the context of code generation. To bridge the gap, we conducted a thematic analysis of the LLM-generated code to summarize and categorize the hallucinations, as well as their causes and impacts. Our study established a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucinations, encompassing 3 primary categories and 12 specific categories. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the distribution of hallucinations, exploring variations among different LLMs and benchmarks. Moreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on the causes and impacts of various hallucinations, aiming to provide valuable insights into hallucination mitigation. Finally, to enhance the correctness and reliability of LLM-generated code in a lightweight manner, we explore training-free hallucination mitigation approaches by prompt enhancing techniques. We believe our findings will shed light on future research about code hallucination evaluation and mitigation, ultimately paving the way for building more effective and reliable code LLMs in the future.

This mismatch is particularly problematic for dysarthric speech, where articulatory imprecision and disfluencies can cause severe semantic distortions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent for post-ASR correction: a Judge-Editor over the top-k ASR hypotheses that keeps high-confidence spans, rewrites uncertain segments, and operates in both zero-shot and fine-tuned modes. In parallel, we release SAP-Hypo5, the largest benchmark for dysarthric speech correction, to enable reproducibility and future exploration. Under multi-perspective evaluation, our agent achieves a 14.51% WER reduction alongside substantial semantic gains, including a +7.59 pp improvement in MENLI and +7.66 pp in Slot Micro F1 on challenging samples. Our analysis further reveals that WER is highly sensitive to domain shift, whereas semantic metrics correlate more closely with downstream task performance.</p></details> |

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></details> |

First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |

Standard fine-tuning of the LLM on target-domain text often disrupts the critical alignment between speech and text modalities learned by the projector, degrading performance. We introduce a novel text-only adaptation method that emulates the audio projection task by treating it as a text denoising task. Our approach thus trains the LLM to recover clean transcripts from noisy inputs. This process effectively adapts the model to a target domain while preserving cross-modal alignment. Our solution is lightweight, requiring no architectural changes or additional parameters. Extensive evaluation on two datasets demonstrates up to 22.1% relative improvement, outperforming recent state-of-the-art text-only adaptation methods.</p></details> |

A common design choice in these architectures is the use of a fixed, manually defined prompt during both training and inference. This setup not only enables applicability across a range of practical scenarios, but also helps maximize model performance. However, the impact of prompt design remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of commonly used prompts across diverse datasets, showing that prompt choice significantly affects ASR performance and introduces instability, with no single prompt performing best across all cases. Inspired by the speech-to-LLM projector, we propose a prompt projector module, a simple, model-agnostic extension that learns to project prompt embeddings to more effective regions of the LLM input space, without modifying the underlying LLM-based ASR model. Experiments on four datasets show that the addition of a prompt projector consistently improves performance, reduces variability, and outperforms the best manually selected prompts.</p></details> |

While robustness is often attributed to scale and diversity, the role of the data distribution is less understood. We systematically examine how curated subsets of pre-training data influence Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance. Surprisingly, optimizing for acoustic, speaker, or linguistic diversity yields no clear improvements over random sampling. Instead, we find that prioritizing the longest utterances achieves superior ASR results while using only half the original dataset, reducing pre-training time by 24% on a large corpora. These findings suggest that for pre-training speech SSL models, data length is a more critical factor than either data diversity or overall data quantity for performance and efficiency, offering a new perspective for data selection strategies in SSL speech processing.</p></details> |

While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age. Ultimately, the article reframes speech inclusion as a matter of equity (not accommodation) and advocates for co-created AI systems that reflect the full spectrum of human voices.</p></details> |

Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss not only scales with input length but also varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the diverse ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 47.1% and the average error by up to 32.9%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and, while motivated by multilingual ASR, offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.</p></details> |

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo</p></details> |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.</p></details> |

ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >= 50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.</p></details> |

However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario. Compared to local sampling baselines, the inverse sensor model improves sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy while preserving multimodal beliefs across objects with varying tactile discriminability.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |

Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.</p></details> |

We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models.</p></details> |

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines.

Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation.

Among the available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure. Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.</p></details> |

Sports officiating is a representative case, where fast, subtle interactions must be judged via symbolic rules. We present FERA (FEncing Referee Assistant), a pose-based framework that turns broadcast foil fencing video into action tokens and rule-grounded explanations. From monocular footage, FERA extracts 2D poses, converts them into a 101-dimensional kinematic representation, and applies an encoder-only transformer (FERA-MDT) to recognize per-fencer footwork, blade actions, and blade-line position. To obtain a consistent single-fencer representation for both athletes, FERA processes each clip and a horizontally flipped copy, yielding time-aligned left/right predictions without requiring a multi-person pose pipeline. A dynamic temporal windowing scheme enables inference on untrimmed pose tracks. These structured predictions serve as tokens for a language model (FERA-LM) that applies simplified right-of-way rules to generate textual decisions. On 1,734 clips (2,386 annotated actions), FERA-MDT achieves a macro-F1 of 0.549 under 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming BiLSTM and TCN baselines. Combined with FERA-LM, the full pipeline recovers referee priority with 77.7% accuracy on 969 exchanges. FERA provides a case-study benchmark for pose-based semantic grounding in a two-person sport and illustrates a general pipeline for connecting video understanding with rule-based reasoning.</p></details> |

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> |

NeckSense captures dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors, including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA vision-based methods.</p></details> |

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.</p></details> |

LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output, reaching the average 3D Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 0.28 m, and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.</p></details> |

For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.</p></details> |
| **25** | **[Unifying Tracking and Image-Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11077v2)** | 2022-11-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Objection detection (OD) has been one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.</p></details> |

The proposed method uses self-supervised learning (SSL) models to extract features from NVs and uses a classifier chain to model the label dependency between emotions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of this task compared to several baseline methods. Our proposed method obtained a mean concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of $0.725$ in the validation set and $0.739$ in the test set, while the best baseline method only obtained $0.554$ in the validation set.

Specifically, we formulate the challenge to adapt an average TTS model to the stylistic target voice with limited data from target speaker, evaluated by speaker identity and style similarity. The challenge consists of two tracks, namely few-shot track and one-shot track, where the participants are required to clone multiple target voices with 100 and 5 samples respectively. There are also two sub-tracks in each track. For sub-track a, to fairly compare different strategies, the participants are allowed to use only the training data provided by the organizer strictly. For sub-track b, the participants are allowed to use any data publicly available.

Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/JS-CHU/RoamScene3D.</p></details> |

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.</p></details> |

Previous 3D talking head generation methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based facial motion representation priors to animate talking motions, yet still produce inaccurate 3D avatar reconstructions, thus undermining the realism of generated animations. We introduce Splat-Portrait, a Gaussian-splatting-based method that addresses the challenges of 3D head reconstruction and lip motion synthesis. Our approach automatically learns to disentangle a single portrait image into a static 3D reconstruction represented as static Gaussian Splatting, and a predicted whole-image 2D background. It then generates natural lip motion conditioned on input audio, without any motion driven priors. Training is driven purely by 2D reconstruction and score-distillation losses, without 3D supervision nor landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Splat-Portrait exhibits superior performance on talking head generation and novel view synthesis, achieving better visual quality compared to previous works. Our project code and supplementary documents are public available at https://github.com/stonewalking/Splat-portrait.</p></details> |

The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency.</p></details> |

Parametric 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) have been widely used for facial reconstruction due to their compact and interpretable parameterization, yet existing 3DMM regressors often exhibit poor consistency across varying viewpoints. To address this, we harness the pre-trained 3D prior of LRM and incorporate FLAME-based 2D Gaussian Splatting into LRM's rendering pipeline. Specifically, KaoLRM projects LRM's pre-trained triplane features into the FLAME parameter space to recover geometry, and models appearance via 2D Gaussian primitives that are tightly coupled to the FLAME mesh. The rich prior enables the FLAME regressor to be aware of the 3D structure, leading to accurate and robust reconstructions under self-occlusions and diverse viewpoints. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that KaoLRM achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and cross-view consistency, while existing methods remain sensitive to viewpoint variations. The code is released at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/KaoLRM.</p></details> |

While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.</p></details> |

We introduce Geodiffussr, a flow-matching pipeline that synthesizes text-guided texture maps while strictly adhering to a supplied Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The core mechanism is multi-scale content aggregation (MCA): DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce global-to-local elevation consistency. Compared with a non-MCA baseline, MCA markedly improves visual fidelity and strengthens height-appearance coupling (FID $\downarrow$ 49.16%, LPIPS $\downarrow$ 32.33%, $Δ$dCor $\downarrow$ to 0.0016). To train and evaluate Geodiffussr, we assemble a globally distributed, biome- and climate-stratified corpus of triplets pairing SRTM-derived DEMs with Sentinel-2 imagery and vision-grounded natural-language captions that describe visible land cover. We position Geodiffussr as a strong baseline and step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.</p></details> |

These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p></details> |

However, without explicit control over multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment, we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.</p></details> |

Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20174v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.</p></details> |

Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

CzechLynx contains 39,760 camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 319 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. In addition to the real camera trap data, we provide a large complementary set of photorealistic synthetic images and a Unity-based generation pipeline with diffusion-based text-to-texture modeling, capable of producing arbitrarily large amounts of synthetic data spanning diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To enable systematic testing across realistic ecological scenarios, we define three complementary evaluation protocols: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set, covering cross-regional and long-term monitoring settings.

We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization. As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.</p></details> |

At the core of our approach is a multi-view consistency mechanism in UV space, which ensures coherent textures across different viewpoints. Specifically, MD-ProjTex fuses noise predictions from multiple views at each diffusion step and jointly updates the per-view denoising directions to maintain 3D consistency. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on optimization or sequential view synthesis, MD-ProjTex is computationally more efficient and achieves better quantitative and qualitative results.</p></details> |

While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\%$ trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality. Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and generalize well for challenging text input. The code is available at https://github.com/theEricMa/TriplaneTurbo.</p></details> |

While recent advances in generative AI have enabled text-to-3D human and clothing synthesis, existing methods fall short in offering accessible, integrated pipelines for generating CG-ready 3D avatars with physically compatible outfits; here we use the term CG-ready for models following a technical aesthetic common in computer graphics (CG) and adopt standard CG polygonal meshes and strands representations (rather than neural representations like NeRF and 3DGS) that can be directly integrated into conventional CG pipelines and support downstream tasks such as physical simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tailor, an integrated text-to-3D framework that generates high-fidelity, customizable 3D avatars dressed in simulation-ready garments. Tailor consists of three stages. (1) Seman tic Parsing: we employ a large language model to interpret textual descriptions and translate them into parameterized human avatars and semantically matched garment templates. (2) Geometry-Aware Garment Generation: we propose topology-preserving deformation with novel geometric losses to generate body-aligned garments under text control. (3) Consistent Texture Synthesis: we propose a novel multi-view diffusion process optimized for garment texturing, which enforces view consistency, preserves photorealistic details, and optionally supports symmetric texture generation common in garments. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that Tailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, usability, and diversity. Our code will be released for academic use. Project page: https://human-tailor.github.io</p></details> |

However, current methods focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D object, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter configurations at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for part-based procedural models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural modeling. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to synthesize texture for a template shape from the procedural model, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other procedural shapes via solving dense correspondence. To ensure interactiveness, we propose a novel correspondence network and show that dense correspondence can be effectively learned by a neural network for procedural models. We also develop several techniques, including a retexturing pipeline to support structural variation from procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting interactive applications.</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that generate the scene sequentially, we frame the problem as single-image panorama and depth estimation. Once the coherent panoramic image and its corresponding depth are obtained, the scene can be reconstructed by inpainting the small occluded regions and projecting them into 3D space. Our key contribution is formulating single-image panorama and depth estimation as two optimization tasks and introducing alternating minimization strategies to effectively solve their objectives. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing techniques in single-image 360° 3D scene reconstruction in terms of consistency and overall quality.</p></details> |

Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.</p></details> |

Unlike existing text-conditioned texture generation methods that typically generate RGB textures with baked lighting, TexPro is able to produce diverse texture maps via procedural material modeling, which enables physically-based rendering, relighting, and additional benefits inherent to procedural materials. Specifically, we first generate multi-view reference images given the input textual prompt by employing the latest text-to-image model. We then derive texture maps through rendering-based optimization with recent differentiable procedural materials. To this end, we design several techniques to handle the misalignment between the generated multi-view images and 3D meshes, and introduce a novel material agent that enhances material classification and matching by exploring both part-level understanding and object-aware material reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing SOTAs, and its capability of relighting.</p></details> |

Not only does the hand occlude much of the object, but also the object is often only visible in a small number of image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emerge in this setting: (1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location and scale of the object, and (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to all possible objects. With these insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigm for hand-held object reconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in large language/vision models and 3D object datasets. Given a monocular RGB video, we aim to reconstruct hand-held object geometry in 3D, over time. In order to obtain the best performing single frame model, we first present MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO), which jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGB image and inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we prompt a text-to-3D generative model using GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object in the image(s); we call this alignment Retrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR). RAR provides unified object geometry across all frames, and the result is rigidly aligned with both the input images and 3D MCC-HO observations in a temporally consistent manner. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet image/video datasets. We make our code and models available on the project website: https://janehwu.github.io/mcc-ho</p></details> |

An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.</p></details> |

Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs. The experiment results show that SecIC3 significantly reduces the time for finding security proofs, with up to 49.3x proof speedup compared to baseline implementations.</p></details> |

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.</p></details> |

We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.</p></details> |

Both machines are deciders, so we prove total correctness. They are typical first examples of Turing machines used in any course of Theoretical Computer Science; in fact, the second machine is literally taken from a relevant textbook. Usually, the correctness of such machines is made plausible by some informal explanations of their basic ideas, augmented with a few sample executions, but neither by rigorous mathematical nor mechanized formal proof. No wonder: The invariants (and variants) required for such proofs are big artifacts, peppered with overpowering technical details. Finding and checking these artifacts without mechanical support is practically impossible, and such support is only available since recent times. But nowadays, just because of these technicalities, with such subjects under proof a program verifier can really show off and demonstrate its capabilities.</p></details> |

It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Automated Theorem Proving for Prolog Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03849v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>LPTP (Logic Program Theorem Prover) is an interactive natural-deduction-based theorem prover for pure Prolog programs with negation as failure, unification with the occurs check, and a restricted but extensible set of built-in predicates. With LPTP, one can formally prove termination and partial correctness of such Prolog programs. LPTP was designed in the mid-1990's by Robert F. Staerk. It is written in ISO-Prolog and comes with an Emacs user-interface. From a theoretical point of view, in his publications about LPTP, Staerk associates a set of first-order axioms IND(P) to the considered Prolog program P. IND(P) contains the Clark's equality theory for P, definitions of success, failure and termination for each user-defined logic procedure in P, axioms relating these three points of view, and an axiom schema for proving inductive properties. LPTP is thus a dedicated proof editor where these axioms are hard-wired. We propose to translate these axioms as first-order formulas (FOFs), and apply automated theorem provers to check the property of interest. Using FOF as an intermediary language, we experiment the use of automated theorem provers for Prolog program verification. We evaluate the approach over a benchmark of about 400 properties of Prolog programs from the library available with LPTP. Both the compiler which generates a set of FOF files from a given input Prolog program together with its properties and the benchmark are publicly available.</p></details> |

However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models. These results demonstrate MATP's potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated reasoning.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Symbolic Specification and Reasoning for Quantum Data and Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22383v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In quantum information and computation research, symbolic methods have been widely used for human specification and reasoning about quantum states and operations. At the same time, they are essential for ensuring the scalability and efficiency of automated reasoning and verification tools for quantum algorithms and programs. However, a formal theory for symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations is still lacking, which significantly limits the practical applicability of automated verification techniques in quantum computing. In this paper, we present a general logical framework, called Symbolic Operator Logic $\mathbf{SOL}$, which enables symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations. Within this framework, a classical first-order logical language is embedded into a language of formal operators used to specify quantum data and operations, including their recursive definitions. This embedding allows reasoning about their properties modulo a chosen theory of the underlying classical data (e.g., Boolean algebra or group theory), thereby leveraging existing automated verification tools developed for classical computing. It should be emphasised that this embedding of classical first-order logic into $\mathbf{SOL}$ is precisely what makes the symbolic method possible. We envision that this framework can provide a conceptual foundation for the formal verification and automated theorem proving of quantum computation and information in proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and related systems.</p></details> |

However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |

We propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for interactive theorem proving and discovery with LLMs. Human experts retain control over problem formulation and admissible assumptions, while the model searches for proofs or contradictions, proposes candidate properties and theorems, and helps construct structures and parameters that satisfy explicit constraints, supported by numerical experiments and simple verification checks. Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities. Although illustrated on manifold optimization problems in quantum computing, the principles extend to other core areas of scientific computing.</p></details> |

Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.</p></details> |
| **13** | **[Formal Verification of Noisy Quantum Reinforcement Learning Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01502v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential sweet spot between classical and quantum computation, where trained QRL policies could still be modeled classically for probabilistic model checking. When the policy was trained under matching noise conditions, this formal model is exact; when trained on physical hardware, it constitutes an idealized approximation, as unknown hardware noise prevents exact policy modeling.</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in theorem proving, complementing symbolic provers. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs can be expensive and may pose security risks for confidential codebases. As a result, purely symbolic approaches remain important even in the LLM era, as they are cost-effective, secure, and complement the strengths of LLMs. Motivated by these considerations, we ask a new research question: can we extract the internal strategies of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of symbolic provers? As an initial attempt to answer this question, we propose Strat2Rocq, which extracts proof strategies from LLMs and formalizes them as lemmas in Rocq. These lemmas are accessible to symbolic provers such as CoqHammer. With the addition of these LLM-extracted lemmas, CoqHammer is able to prove more theorems. The knowledge extraction process involves analyzing the proof trajectories of LLMs on a training set of proved theorems. For each theorem, we prompt the LLM to generate a natural language proof, then ask it to summarize this proof into formalized lemmas with proofs. We also employ a standard agentic approach to mitigate errors during formalization. Our evaluation demonstrates that, on open-source Rocq projects for software verification, Strat2Rocq enhances the success rate of CoqHammer by 13.41%.</p></details> |

The equivalence was originally established by Cangiotti, Linzi, and Talotti in their study of hypercompositional structures related to orthomodular lattices and quantum logic. Our formalization rigorously verifies the main theoretical result and demonstrates the mutual inverse property of the transformations establishing this equivalence. The development showcases both the mathematical depth of multivalued algebraic operations and the potential for AI-enhanced interactive theorem proving in tackling complex formalization projects.</p></details> |

Lisp-Z3 allows one to develop tools written using the full feature set of Common Lisp that can use both ACL2/s (either ACL2 or ACL2s) and Z3 as services, combining the power of SMT and interactive theorem proving. Lisp-Z3 is usable by anyone who would like to interact with Z3 from Common Lisp, as it does not depend on the availability of ACL2/s. We discuss the use of Lisp-Z3 in three applications. The first is a Sudoku solver. The second is SeqSolve, a string solver which solved a larger number of benchmark problems more quickly than any other existing solver at the time of its publishing. Finally, Lisp-Z3 was also used in the context of hardware-in-the-loop fuzzing of wireless routers, where low latency was an important goal. The latter two applications leveraged the ability of Lisp-Z3 to integrate Z3 with ACL2s code. We have further plans to use Lisp-Z3 inside of ACL2s to provide more powerful automated support for dependent types, and in particular more efficient generation of counterexamples to properties involving dependent types. This paper describes the usage and implementation of Lisp-Z3, as well as an evaluation of its use in the aforementioned applications.</p></details> |
| **17** | **[Interpolation with Automated First-Order Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01577v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider interpolation from the viewpoint of fully automated theorem proving in first-order logic as a general core technique for mechanized knowledge processing. For Craig interpolation, our focus is on the two-stage approach, where first an essentially propositional ground interpolant is calculated that is then lifted to a quantified first-order formula. We discuss two possibilities to obtain a ground interpolant from a proof: with clausal tableaux, and with resolution. Established preprocessing techniques for first-order proving can also be applied for Craig interpolation if they are restricted in specific ways. Equality encodings from automated reasoning justify strengthened variations of Craig interpolation. Contributions to Craig interpolation that emerged from automated reasoning include variations for logics used in databases and logic programming. As an approach to uniform interpolation we introduce second-order quantifier elimination with examples and describe the basic algorithms DLS and SCAN.</p></details> |
| **18** | **[Quantifying Bounded Rationality: Formal Verification of Simon's Satisficing Through Flexible Stochastic Dominance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07052v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper introduces Flexible First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FFSD), a mathematically rigorous framework that formalizes Herbert Simon's concept of bounded rationality using the Lean 4 theorem prover. We develop machine-verified proofs demonstrating that FFSD bridges classical expected utility theory with Simon's satisficing behavior through parameterized tolerance thresholds. Our approach yields several key results: (1) a critical threshold $\varepsilon < 1/2$ that guarantees uniqueness of reference points, (2) an equivalence theorem linking FFSD to expected utility maximization for approximate indicator functions, and (3) extensions to multi-dimensional decision settings. By encoding these concepts in Lean 4's dependent type theory, we provide the first machine-checked formalization of Simon's bounded rationality, creating a foundation for mechanized reasoning about economic decision-making under uncertainty with cognitive limitations. This work contributes to the growing intersection between formal mathematics and economic theory, demonstrating how interactive theorem proving can advance our understanding of behavioral economics concepts that have traditionally been expressed only qualitatively.</p></details> |

To lay this bare, we recall the costs of some of the major software failures that happened during the last 40 years. We argue that these costs justify researching, studying and applying formal software verification and in particular program analysis. This position is supported by successful industrial experiences.</p></details> |
| **20** | **[Automated Discovery of Tactic Libraries for Interactive Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24036v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Enabling more concise and modular proofs is essential for advancing formal reasoning using interactive theorem provers (ITPs). Since many ITPs, such as Rocq and Lean, use tactic-style proofs, learning higher-level custom tactics is crucial for proof modularity and automation. This paper presents a novel approach to tactic discovery, which leverages Tactic Dependence Graphs (TDGs) to identify reusable proof strategies across multiple proofs. TDGs capture logical dependencies between tactic applications while abstracting away irrelevant syntactic details, allowing for both the discovery of new tactics and the refactoring of existing proofs into more modular forms. We have implemented this technique in a tool called TacMiner and compare it against an anti-unification-based approach Peano to tactic discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that TacMiner can learn 3x as many tactics as Peano and reduces the size of proofs by 26% across all benchmarks. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of learning custom tactics for proof automation, allowing a state-of-the-art proof automation tool to achieve a relative increase of 172% in terms of success rate.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof Progress Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17925v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.8% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.4%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.
