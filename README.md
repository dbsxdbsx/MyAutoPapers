| **1** | **[Handling Delay in Real-Time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23478v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Real-time reinforcement learning (RL) introduces several challenges. First, policies are constrained to a fixed number of actions per second due to hardware limitations. Second, the environment may change while the network is still computing an action, leading to observational delay. The first issue can partly be addressed with pipelining, leading to higher throughput and potentially better policies. However, the second issue remains: if each neuron operates in parallel with an execution time of $\tau$, an $N$-layer feed-forward network experiences observation delay of $\tau N$. Reducing the number of layers can decrease this delay, but at the cost of the network's expressivity. In this work, we explore the trade-off between minimizing delay and network's expressivity. We present a theoretically motivated solution that leverages temporal skip connections combined with history-augmented observations. We evaluate several architectures and show that those incorporating temporal skip connections achieve strong performance across various neuron execution times, reinforcement learning algorithms, and environments, including four Mujoco tasks and all MinAtar games. Moreover, we demonstrate parallel neuron computation can accelerate inference by 6-350% on standard hardware. Our investigation into temporal skip connections and parallel computations paves the way for more efficient RL agents in real-time setting.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Provably Efficient RL for Linear MDPs under Instantaneous Safety Constraints in Non-Convex Feature Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18655v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), tasks with instantaneous hard constraints present significant challenges, particularly when the decision space is non-convex or non-star-convex. This issue is especially relevant in domains like autonomous vehicles and robotics, where constraints such as collision avoidance often take a non-convex form. In this paper, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(\bigl(1 + \tfrac{1}{\tau}\bigr) \sqrt{\log(\tfrac{1}{\tau}) d^3 H^4 K} \bigr)$, applicable to both star-convex and non-star-convex cases, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ the episode length, $K$ the number of episodes, and $\tau$ the safety threshold. Moreover, the violation of safety constraints is zero with high probability throughout the learning process. A key technical challenge in these settings is bounding the covering number of the value-function class, which is essential for achieving value-aware uniform concentration in model-free function approximation. For the star-convex setting, we develop a novel technique called Objective Constraint-Decomposition (OCD) to properly bound the covering number. This result also resolves an error in a previous work on constrained RL. In non-star-convex scenarios, where the covering number can become infinitely large, we propose a two-phase algorithm, Non-Convex Safe Least Squares Value Iteration (NCS-LSVI), which first reduces uncertainty about the safe set by playing a known safe policy. After that, it carefully balances exploration and exploitation to achieve the regret bound. Finally, numerical simulations on an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of NCS-LSVI.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Constrained MDPs with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10138v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Improving Transformer World Models for Data-Efficient RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01591v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following task instructions, and a low-level quadruped locomotion policy, 2) a teacher and student training pipeline for the high level, which trains a teacher to tackle long-horizon tasks using privileged task decomposition and target object information, and further trains a student for visual-mobile manipulation via RL guided by the teacher's behavior, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing the sim-to-real gap. In contrast to many previous works that use high-end equipments, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware -- specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX-250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera -- despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Trained fully in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks involving search, move to, grasp, transport, and drop into, achieving nearly 80% real-world success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks while the robot is more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed of the teleoperation. Finally, we perform extensive ablations on key techniques for efficient RL training and effective sim-to-real transfer, and demonstrate effective deployment across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under various lighting conditions.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Precise and Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21845v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for enabling autonomous acquisition of complex robotic manipulation skills, but realizing this potential in real-world settings has been challenging. We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

| **7** | **[Uncovering RL Integration in SSL Loss: Objective-Specific Implications for Data-Efficient RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17428v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this study, we investigate the effect of SSL objective modifications within the SPR framework, focusing on specific adjustments such as terminal state masking and prioritized replay weighting, which were not explicitly addressed in the original design. While these modifications are specific to RL, they are not universally applicable across all RL algorithms. Therefore, we aim to assess their impact on performance and explore other SSL objectives that do not accommodate these adjustments like Barlow Twins and VICReg. We evaluate six SPR variants on the Atari 100k benchmark, including versions both with and without these modifications. Additionally, we test the performance of these objectives on the DeepMind Control Suite, where such modifications are absent. Our findings reveal that incorporating specific SSL modifications within SPR significantly enhances performance, and this influence extends to subsequent frameworks like SR-SPR and BBF, highlighting the critical importance of SSL objective selection and related adaptations in achieving data efficiency in self-predictive reinforcement learning.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Computationally Efficient RL under Linear Bellman Completeness for Deterministic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11810v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study computationally and statistically efficient Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the linear Bellman Complete setting. This setting uses linear function approximation to capture value functions and unifies existing models like linear Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While it is known from the prior works that this setting is statistically tractable, it remained open whether a computationally efficient algorithm exists. Our work provides a computationally efficient algorithm for the linear Bellman complete setting that works for MDPs with large action spaces, random initial states, and random rewards but relies on the underlying dynamics to be deterministic. Our approach is based on randomization: we inject random noise into least squares regression problems to perform optimistic value iteration. Our key technical contribution is to carefully design the noise to only act in the null space of the training data to ensure optimism while circumventing a subtle error amplification issue.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[An Efficient Reservation Protocol for Medium Access: When Tree Splitting Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02376v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>As an enhanced version of massive machine-type communication in 5G, massive communication has emerged as one of the six usage scenarios anticipated for 6G, owing to its potential in industrial internet-of-things and smart metering. Driven by the need for random multiple-access (RMA) in massive communication, as well as, next-generation Wi-Fi, medium access control has attracted considerable recent attention. Holding the promise of attaining bandwidth-efficient collision resolution, multiaccess reservation no doubt plays a central role in RMA, e.g., the distributed coordination function (DCF) in IEEE 802.11. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of reservation protocols for RMA under quality-of-service constraints. Particularly, we present a tree splitting based reservation scheme, in which the attempting probability is dynamically optimized by partially observable Markov decision process or reinforcement learning (RL). The RL-empowered tree-splitting algorithm guarantees that all these terminals with backlogged packets at the beginning of a contention cycle can be scheduled, thereby providing a first-in-first-out service. More importantly, it substantially reduces the reservation bandwidth determined by the communication complexity of DCF, through judiciously conceived coding and interaction for exchanging information required by distributed ordering. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the CSMA/CA based DCF in IEEE 802.11.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Off-Policy Evaluation for Sequential Persuasion Process with Unobserved Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01211v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper, we expand the Bayesian persuasion framework to account for unobserved confounding variables in sender-receiver interactions. While traditional models assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver's belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver's belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender's incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver's beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Real-time Tracking System with Partially Coupled Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21552v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Observation Adaptation via Annealed Importance Resampling for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19302v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general mathematical model for sequential decision-making in stochastic environments under state uncertainty. POMDPs are often solved \textit{online}, which enables the algorithm to adapt to new information in real time. Online solvers typically use bootstrap particle filters based on importance resampling for updating the belief distribution. Since directly sampling from the ideal state distribution given the latest observation and previous state is infeasible, particle filters approximate the posterior belief distribution by propagating states and adjusting weights through prediction and resampling steps. However, in practice, the importance resampling technique often leads to particle degeneracy and sample impoverishment when the state transition model poorly aligns with the posterior belief distribution, especially when the received observation is highly informative. We propose an approach that constructs a sequence of bridge distributions between the state-transition and optimal distributions through iterative Monte Carlo steps, better accommodating noisy observations in online POMDP solvers. Our algorithm demonstrates significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated across multiple challenging POMDP domains.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Parameter Adjustments in POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for Unsignalized Intersections](http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0012742400003702)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Induced Model Matching: Restricted Models Help Train Full-Featured Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12513v2)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We consider scenarios where a very accurate (often small) predictive model using restricted features is available when training a full-featured (often larger) model. This restricted model may be thought of as side-information'', and can come either from an auxiliary dataset or from the same dataset by forcing the restriction. How can the restricted model be useful to the full model? To answer this, we introduce a methodology called Induced Model Matching (IMM). IMM aligns the context-restricted, or induced, version of the large model with the restricted model. We relate IMM to approaches such as noising, which is implicit in addressing the problem, and reverse knowledge distillation from weak teachers, which is explicit but does not exploit restriction being the nature of the weakness. We show that these prior methods can be thought of as approximations to IMM and can be problematic in terms of consistency. Experimentally, we first motivate IMM using logistic regression as a toy example. We then explore it in language modeling, the application that initially inspired it, and demonstrate it on both LSTM and transformer full models, using bigrams as restricted models. We lastly give a simple RL example, which shows that POMDP policies can help learn better MDP policies. The IMM principle is thus generally applicable in common scenarios where restricted data is cheaper to collect or restricted models are easier to learn.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Online POMDP Planning with Anytime Deterministic Optimality Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01791v4)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Decision-making under uncertainty is a critical aspect of many practical autonomous systems due to incomplete information. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a mathematically principled framework for formulating decision-making problems under such conditions. However, finding an optimal solution for a POMDP is generally intractable. In recent years, there has been a significant progress of scaling approximate solvers from small to moderately sized problems, using online tree search solvers. Often, such approximate solvers are limited to probabilistic or asymptotic guarantees towards the optimal solution. In this paper, we derive a deterministic relationship for discrete POMDPs between an approximated and the optimal solution. We show that at any time, we can derive bounds that relate between the existing solution and the optimal one. We show that our derivations provide an avenue for a new set of algorithms and can be attached to existing algorithms that have a certain structure to provide them with deterministic guarantees with marginal computational overhead. In return, not only do we certify the solution quality, but we demonstrate that making a decision based on the deterministic guarantee may result in superior performance compared to the original algorithm without the deterministic certification.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets. With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging. Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks. Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01114v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459v2)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/dyunis/subwords_as_skills}.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Language Reward Modulation for Pretraining Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12270v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Using learned reward functions (LRFs) as a means to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has yielded some steady progress in task-complexity through the years. In this work, we question whether today's LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p></details> |

However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL.

To improve learning efficiency for such tasks, this paper proposes a DRL exploration technique, termed A^2, which integrates two components inspired by human experiences: Abstract demonstrations and Adaptive exploration. A^2 starts by decomposing a complex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to learn. During training, the agent explores the environment adaptively, acting more deterministically for well-mastered subtasks and more stochastically for ill-learnt subtasks. Ablation and comparative experiments are conducted on several grid-world tasks and three robotic manipulation tasks. We demonstrate that A^2 can aid popular DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, and SAC) to learn more efficiently and stably in these environments.</p></details> |

Detecting Deception in Negotiations using Counterfactual RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12436v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>An increasingly prevalent socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.</p></details> |

In some scenarios such as healthcare, however, usually only few records are available for each patient, and patients may show different responses to the same treatment, impeding the application of current RL algorithms to learn optimal policies. To address the issues of mechanism heterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL algorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state dynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences across subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what would have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real (possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences lead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both population-level and individual-level policies. We show that counterfactual outcomes are identifiable under mild conditions and that Q- learning on the counterfactual-based augmented data set converges to the optimal value function. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Enhanced Marginal Sensitivity Model and Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08301v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Sensitivity analysis is important to assess the impact of unmeasured confounding in causal inference from observational studies. The marginal sensitivity model (MSM) provides a useful approach in quantifying the influence of unmeasured confounders on treatment assignment and leading to tractable sharp bounds of common causal parameters. In this paper, to tighten MSM sharp bounds, we propose the enhanced MSM (eMSM) by incorporating another sensitivity constraint that quantifies the influence of unmeasured confounders on outcomes. We derive sharp population bounds of expected potential outcomes under eMSM, which are always narrower than the MSM sharp bounds in a simple and interpretable way. We further discuss desirable specifications of sensitivity parameters related to the outcome sensitivity constraint, and obtain both doubly robust point estimation and confidence intervals for the eMSM population bounds. The effectiveness of eMSM is also demonstrated numerically through two real-data applications. Our development represents, for the first time, a satisfactory extension of MSM to exploit both treatment and outcome sensitivity constraints on unmeasured confounding.</p></details> |

Quantitative bias analysis (QBA) methods examine the sensitivity of findings to such violations, generally by producing bias-adjusted estimates under alternative assumptions. Common strategies for QBA address either a single source of bias or multiple sources one at a time, thus not informing the overall impact of the potential biases. We propose a systematic approach (roadmap) for identifying and analysing multiple biases together. Briefly, this consists of (i) articulating the assumptions underlying the primary analysis through specification and emulation of the "ideal trial" that defines the causal estimand of interest and depicting these assumptions using casual diagrams; (ii) depicting alternative assumptions under which biases arise using causal diagrams; (iii) obtaining a single estimate simultaneously adjusted for all biases under the alternative assumptions. We illustrate the roadmap in an investigation of the effect of breastfeeding on risk of childhood asthma. We further use simulations to evaluate a recent simultaneous adjustment approach and illustrate the need for simultaneous rather than one-at-a-time adjustment to examine the overall impact of biases. The proposed roadmap should facilitate the conduct of high-quality multiple bias analyses.</p></details> |

We introduce the concept of ``partial ignorabilty" and leverage it to establish a novel convergence theorem for adaptive Reinforcement Learning. This theoretical result relaxes the Markov assumption on the stochastic process underlying conventional $Q$-learning, deploying a generalized form of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation theorem to establish optimality. This result has clear downstream implications for most active subfields of Reinforcement Learning, with clear paths for extension to the field of Causal Inference.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Better Decisions through the Right Causal World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07257v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have shown remarkable performances in various environments, where they can discover effective policies directly from sensory inputs. However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in the training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to new or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal Object-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties. Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal variables to enhance interpretability. By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts, permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Causal Inference under Interference through Designed Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07217v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Equilibrium effects make it challenging to evaluate the impact of an individual-level treatment on outcomes in a single market, even with data from a randomized trial. In some markets, however, a centralized mechanism allocates goods and imposes useful structure on spillovers. For a class of strategy-proof "cutoff" mechanisms, we propose an estimator for global treatment effects using individual-level data from one market, where treatment assignment is unconfounded. Algorithmically, we re-run a weighted and perturbed version of the mechanism. Under a continuum market approximation, the estimator is asymptotically normal and semi-parametrically efficient. We extend this approach to learn spillover-aware treatment rules with vanishing asymptotic regret. Empirically, adjusting for equilibrium effects notably diminishes the estimated effect of information on inequality in the Chilean school system.</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.</p></details> |

A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[When Counterfactual Reasoning Fails: Chaos and Real-World Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23820v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Counterfactual reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition and decision-making, is often seen as the 'holy grail' of causal learning, with applications ranging from interpreting machine learning models to promoting algorithmic fairness. While counterfactual reasoning has been extensively studied in contexts where the underlying causal model is well-defined, real-world causal modeling is often hindered by model and parameter uncertainty, observational noise, and chaotic behavior. The reliability of counterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the framework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate \emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes increasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low degrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in counterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and true counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying counterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty. Furthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose fundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about their behavior.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[A Causal Framework to Measure and Mitigate Non-binary Treatment Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22454v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Fairness studies of algorithmic decision-making systems often simplify complex decision processes, such as bail or loan approvals, into binary classification tasks. However, these approaches overlook that such decisions are not inherently binary (e.g., approve or not approve bail or loan); they also involve non-binary treatment decisions (e.g., bail conditions or loan terms) that can influence the downstream outcomes (e.g., loan repayment or reoffending). In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses and explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the treatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our framework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in historical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact of past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our framework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to reveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their discriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate treatment decisions in fairness assessments. Moreover, by intervening in treatment decisions, we show that our framework effectively mitigates treatment discrimination from historical data to ensure fair risk score estimation and (non-binary) decision-making processes that benefit all stakeholders.</p></details> |

However, applying counterfactual methods to time series models remains challenging due to temporal dependencies, high dimensionality, and the lack of an intuitive human-interpretable representation. We introduce MASCOTS, a method that leverages the Bag-of-Receptive-Fields representation alongside symbolic transformations inspired by Symbolic Aggregate Approximation. By operating in a symbolic feature space, it enhances interpretability while preserving fidelity to the original data and model. Unlike existing approaches that either depend on model structure or autoencoder-based sampling, MASCOTS directly generates meaningful and diverse counterfactual observations in a model-agnostic manner, operating on both univariate and multivariate data. We evaluate MASCOTS on univariate and multivariate benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable validity, proximity, and plausibility to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly improving interpretability and sparsity. Its symbolic nature allows for explanations that can be expressed visually, in natural language, or through semantic representations, making counterfactual reasoning more accessible and actionable.</p></details> |

Our focus is on settings relaxing causal sufficiency, i.e. allowing for latent variables which may arise because relevant information could not be measured at all, or not jointly, as in the case of multiple overlapping datasets. We first present novel insights into the properties of the 'tiered FCI' (tFCI) algorithm. Building on this, we introduce a new extension of the IOD (integrating overlapping datasets) algorithm incorporating tiered background knowledge, the 'tiered IOD' (tIOD) algorithm. We show that under full usage of the tiered background knowledge tFCI and tIOD are sound, while simple versions of the tIOD and tFCI are sound and complete. We further show that the tIOD algorithm can often be expected to be considerably more efficient and informative than the IOD algorithm even beyond the obvious restriction of the Markov equivalence classes. We provide a formal result on the conditions for this gain in efficiency and informativeness. Our results are accompanied by a series of examples illustrating the exact role and usefulness of tiered background knowledge.</p></details> |
| **12** | **[A Contextual Approach to Technological Understanding and Its Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21437v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Technological understanding is not a singular concept but varies depending on the context. Building on De Jong and De Haro's (2025) notion of technological understanding as the ability to realise an aim by using a technological artefact, this paper further refines the concept as an ability that varies by context and degree. We extend its original specification for a design context by introducing two additional contexts: operation and innovation. Each context represents a distinct way of realising an aim through technology, resulting in three types (specifications) of technological understanding. To further clarify the nature of technological understanding, we propose an assessment framework based on counterfactual reasoning. Each type of understanding is associated with the ability to answer a specific set of what-if questions, addressing changes in an artefact's structure, performance, or appropriateness. Explicitly distinguishing these different types helps to focus efforts to improve technological understanding, clarifies the epistemic requirements for different forms of engagement with technology, and promotes a pluralistic perspective on expertise.</p></details> |

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation and error detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.</p></details> |

A common approach, implicit parameterization, encodes unobserved confounding by modifying the off-diagonal entries of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix while preserving positive definiteness. Within this approach, we identify that state-of-the-art protocols have two distinct issues that hinder unbiased sampling from the complete space of causal models: first, we give a detailed analysis of use of diagonally dominant constructions restricts the spectrum of partial correlation matrices; and second, the restriction of possible graphical structures when sampling bidirected edges, unnecessarily ruling out valid causal models. To address these limitations, we propose an improved explicit modeling approach for unobserved confounding, leveraging block-hierarchical ancestral generation of ground truth causal graphs. Algorithms for converting the ground truth DAG into ancestral graph is provided so that the output of causal discovery algorithms could be compared with. We draw connections between implicit and explicit parameterization, prove that our approach fully covers the space of causal models, including those generated by the implicit parameterization, thus enabling more robust evaluation of methods for causal discovery and inference.</p></details> |
| **16** | **[Counterfactual Situation Testing: From Single to Multidimensional Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01267v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present counterfactual situation testing (CST), a causal data mining framework for detecting individual discrimination in a dataset of classifier decisions. CST answers the question ``what would have been the model outcome had the individual, or complainant, been of a different protected status?'' It extends the legally-grounded situation testing (ST) of Thanh et al. (2011) by operationalizing the notion of "fairness given the difference" via counterfactual reasoning. ST finds for each complainant similar protected and non-protected instances in the dataset; constructs, respectively, a control and test group; and compares the groups such that a difference in model outcomes implies a potential case of individual discrimination. CST, instead, avoids this idealized comparison by establishing the test group on the complainant's generated counterfactual, which reflects how the protected attribute when changed influences other seemingly neutral attributes of the complainant. Under CST we test for discrimination for each complainant by comparing similar individuals within the control and test group but dissimilar individuals across these groups. We consider single (e.g.,~gender) and multidimensional (e.g.,~gender and race) discrimination testing. For multidimensional discrimination we study multiple and intersectional discrimination and, as feared by legal scholars, find evidence that the former fails to account for the latter kind. Using a k-nearest neighbor implementation, we showcase CST on synthetic and real data. Experimental results show that CST uncovers a higher number of cases than ST, even when the model is counterfactually fair. CST, in fact, extends counterfactual fairness (CF) of Kusner et al. (2017) by equipping CF with confidence intervals, which we report for all experiments.</p></details> |

However, directly inverting propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.</p></details> |

These models are often modified to include the effects of interventions (control measures) such as vaccination, social distancing, school closings etc. Many such models were proposed during the COVID-19 epidemic. Inevitably these models are used to answer the question: What is the effect of the intervention on the epidemic? These models can either be interpreted as data generating models describing observed random variables or as causal models for counterfactual random variables. These two interpretations are often conflated in the literature. We discuss the difference between these two types of models, and then we discuss how to estimate the parameters of the model.</p></details> |

Existing methods require observational data from a number of sufficiently different environments, which is rarely available. In this paper, we consider a structural equation model where the target variable is described by a generalized linear model conditional on its parents. Besides having finite moments, no modelling assumptions are made on the conditional distributions of the other variables in the system, and nonlinear effects on the target variable can naturally be accommodated by a generalized additive structure. Under this setting, we characterize the causal model uniquely by means of two key properties: the Pearson risk invariant under the causal model and, conditional on the causal parents, the causal parameters maximize the expected likelihood. These two properties form the basis of a computational strategy for searching the causal model among all possible models. A stepwise greedy search is proposed for systems with a large number of variables. Crucially, for generalized linear models with a known dispersion parameter, such as Poisson and logistic regression, the causal model can be identified from a single data environment. The method is implemented in the R package causalreg.</p></details> |

Exploring Large Language Models for Causal Graph Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16899v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>This study explores the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate causality in causal graphs generated by conventional statistical causal discovery methods-a task traditionally reliant on manual assessment by human subject matter experts. To bridge this gap in causality assessment, LLMs are employed to evaluate the causal relationships by determining whether a causal connection between variable pairs can be inferred from textual context. Our study compares two approaches: (1) prompting-based method for zero-shot and few-shot causal inference and, (2) fine-tuning language models for the causal relation prediction task. While prompt-based LLMs have demonstrated versatility across various NLP tasks, our experiments on biomedical and general-domain datasets show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform them, achieving up to a 20.5-point improvement in F1 score-even when using smaller-parameter language models. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches for causal graph evaluation.</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate CSIvA (Ke et al., 2023), a transformer-based model promising to train on synthetic data and transfer to real data. First, we bridge the gap with existing identifiability theory and show that constraints on the training data distribution implicitly define a prior on the test observations. Consistent with classical approaches, good performance is achieved when we have a good prior on the test data, and the underlying model is identifiable. At the same time, we find new trade-offs. Training on datasets generated from different classes of causal models, unambiguously identifiable in isolation, improves the test generalization. Performance is still guaranteed, as the ambiguous cases resulting from the mixture of identifiable causal models are unlikely to occur (which we formally prove). Overall, our study finds that amortized causal discovery still needs to obey identifiability theory, but it also differs from classical methods in how the assumptions are formulated, trading more reliance on assumptions on the noise type for fewer hypotheses on the mechanisms.</p></details> |

Common evaluation metrics such as the structural Hamming distance are useful for assessing individual links of causal graphs. However, many state-of-the-art causal discovery methods do not output single causal graphs, but rather their Markov equivalence classes (MECs) which encode all of the graph's separation and connection statements. In this work, we propose additional measures of distance that capture the difference in separations of two causal graphs which link-based distances are not fit to assess. The proposed distances have low polynomial time complexity and are applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as well as to maximal ancestral graph (MAGs) that may contain bidirected edges. We complement our theoretical analysis with toy examples and empirical experiments that highlight the differences to existing comparison metrics.</p></details> |

However, causal discovery algorithms over larger sets of variables tend to be brittle against misspecification or when data are limited. For example, single-cell transcriptomics measures thousands of genes, but the nature of their relationships is not known, and there may be as few as tens of cells per intervention setting. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a foundation model-inspired approach: a supervised model trained on large-scale, synthetic data to predict causal graphs from summary statistics -- like the outputs of classical causal discovery algorithms run over subsets of variables and other statistical hints like inverse covariance. Our approach is enabled by the observation that typical errors in the outputs of a discovery algorithm remain comparable across datasets. Theoretically, we show that the model architecture is well-specified, in the sense that it can recover a causal graph consistent with graphs over subsets. Empirically, we train the model to be robust to misspecification and distribution shift using diverse datasets. Experiments on biological and synthetic data confirm that this model generalizes well beyond its training set, runs on graphs with hundreds of variables in seconds, and can be easily adapted to different underlying data assumptions.</p></details> |

However, the main challenge in implementing ECA lies in accessing real-world or historical clinical trials data. Indeed, regulations protecting patients' rights by strictly controlling data processing make pooling data from multiple sources in a central server often difficult. To address these limitations, we develop a new method, 'FedECA' that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for time-to-event outcomes on separate cohorts without needing to pool data. To showcase the potential of FedECA, we apply it in different settings of increasing complexity culminating with a real-world use-case in which FedECA is used to compare the treatment effect of two approved chemotherapy regimens using data from three separate cohorts of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. By sharing our code, we hope FedECA will foster the creation of federated research networks and thus accelerate drug development.</p></details> |

Federated Learning (FL) offers an alternative approach, but existing FL methods struggle with low-level vision tasks, leading to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this, we propose FedVSR1, a novel, architecture-independent, and stateless FL framework for VSR. Our approach introduces a lightweight loss term that improves local optimization and guides global aggregation with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at federated VSR. Extensive experiments show that FedVSR outperforms general FL methods by an average of 0.85 dB in PSNR, highlighting its effectiveness.

Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR. Source code will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Implicit Neural Representation for Video and Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04665v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present a novel approach for super-resolution that utilizes implicit neural representation (INR) to effectively reconstruct and enhance low-resolution videos and images. By leveraging the capacity of neural networks to implicitly encode spatial and temporal features, our method facilitates high-resolution reconstruction using only low-resolution inputs and a 3D high-resolution grid. This results in an efficient solution for both image and video super-resolution. Our proposed method, SR-INR, maintains consistent details across frames and images, achieving impressive temporal stability without relying on the computationally intensive optical flow or motion estimation typically used in other video super-resolution techniques. The simplicity of our approach contrasts with the complexity of many existing methods, making it both effective and efficient. Experimental evaluations show that SR-INR delivers results on par with or superior to state-of-the-art super-resolution methods, while maintaining a more straightforward structure and reduced computational demands. These findings highlight the potential of implicit neural representations as a powerful tool for reconstructing high-quality, temporally consistent video and image signals from low-resolution data.</p></details> |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p></details> |

While transformer-based VSR models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years, these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand, lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.</p></details> |

Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve--and even degrades--performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art in various metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Knowledge Distillation for Multimodal Egocentric Action Recognition Robust to Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08578v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Action recognition is an essential task in egocentric vision due to its wide range of applications across many fields. While deep learning methods have been proposed to address this task, most rely on a single modality, typically video. However, including additional modalities may improve the robustness of the approaches to common issues in egocentric videos, such as blurriness and occlusions. Recent efforts in multimodal egocentric action recognition often assume the availability of all modalities, leading to failures or performance drops when any modality is missing. To address this, we introduce an efficient multimodal knowledge distillation approach for egocentric action recognition that is robust to missing modalities (KARMMA) while still benefiting when multiple modalities are available. Our method focuses on resource-efficient development by leveraging pre-trained models as unimodal feature extractors in our teacher model, which distills knowledge into a much smaller and faster student model. Experiments on the Epic-Kitchens and Something-Something datasets demonstrate that our student model effectively handles missing modalities while reducing its accuracy drop in this scenario.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Proxy-Anchor and EVT-Driven Continual Learning Method for Generalized Category Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08550v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Continual generalized category discovery has been introduced and studied in the literature as a method that aims to continuously discover and learn novel categories in incoming data batches while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned categories. A key component in addressing this challenge is the model's ability to separate novel samples, where Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has been effectively employed. In this work, we propose a novel method that integrates EVT with proxy anchors to define boundaries around proxies using a probability of inclusion function, enabling the rejection of unknown samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel EVT-based loss function to enhance the learned representation, achieving superior performance compared to other deep-metric learning methods in similar settings. Using the derived probability functions, novel samples are effectively separated from previously known categories. However, category discovery within these novel samples can sometimes overestimate the number of new categories. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel EVT-based approach to reduce the model size and discard redundant proxies. We also incorporate experience replay and knowledge distillation mechanisms during the continual learning stage to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in continual generalized category discovery scenarios.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[A Systematic Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Gene-Disease Association Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08445v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Discovery gene-disease links is important in biology and medicine areas, enabling disease identification and drug repurposing. Machine learning approaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge represented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs. Still, many existing works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases, missing causal and semantic relationships between them. The gene-disease association problem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task, where embedding algorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and properties of the knowledge graph. Some works frame it as a node-pair classification task, combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine learning algorithms. This strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning pipeline. However, the use of negative examples and the lack of validated gene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its effectiveness. This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the performance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses the performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and compares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association prediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a disease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The framework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration, embedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that enriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves performance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction methods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs. Although node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link prediction methods outperform overall.</p></details> |

We propose a novel system, Ontology and Semantic Exploration Toolkit (OnSET) that allows non-expert users to easily build queries with visual user guidance provided by topic modelling and semantic search throughout the application. OnSET allows users without any prior information about the ontology or networked knowledge to start exploring topics of interest over knowledge graphs, including the retrieval and detailed exploration of prototypical sub-graphs and their instances. Existing systems either focus on direct graph explorations or do not foster further exploration of the result set. We, however, provide a node-based editor that can extend on these missing properties of existing systems to support the search over big ontologies with sub-graph instances. Furthermore, OnSET combines efficient and open platforms to deploy the system on commodity hardware.</p></details> |

Vision-based methods offer cost-effective solutions for localization and mapping in the absence of conventional sensors like GPS and LIDAR. However, underwater environments present significant challenges for feature extraction and matching due to image blurring and noise caused by attenuation, scattering, and the interference of \textit{marine snow}. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of the feature extraction and matching in the turbid underwater environment using the cross-modal knowledge distillation method that transfers the in-air feature extraction models to underwater settings using synthetic underwater images as the medium. We first propose a novel adaptive GAN-synthesis method to estimate water parameters and underwater noise distribution, to generate environment-specific synthetic underwater images. We then introduce a general knowledge distillation framework compatible with different teacher models. The evaluation of GAN-based synthesis highlights the significance of the new components, i.e. GAN-synthesized noise and forward scattering, in the proposed model. Additionally, the downstream application of feature extraction and matching (VSLAM) on real underwater sequences validates the effectiveness of the transferred model.</p></details> |

Existing pose datasets often simplify the spine to a single rigid segment, overlooking the nuanced articulation required for accurate motion analysis. In contrast, SpineTrack annotates nine detailed spinal keypoints across two complementary subsets: a synthetic set comprising 25k annotations created using Unreal Engine with biomechanical alignment through OpenSim, and a real-world set comprising over 33k annotations curated via an active learning pipeline that iteratively refines automated annotations with human feedback. This integrated approach ensures anatomically consistent labels at scale, even for challenging, in-the-wild images. We further introduce SpinePose, extending state-of-the-art body pose estimators using knowledge distillation and an anatomical regularization strategy to jointly predict body and spine keypoints. Our experiments in both general and sports-specific contexts validate the effectiveness of SpineTrack for precise spine pose estimation, establishing a robust foundation for future research in advanced biomechanical analysis and 3D spine reconstruction in the wild.</p></details> |

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

| **8** | **[SoTA with Less: MCTS-Guided Sample Selection for Data-Efficient Visual Reasoning Self-Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper, we present an effective method to enhance visual reasoning with significantly fewer training samples, relying purely on self-improvement with no knowledge distillation. Our key insight is that the difficulty of training data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately challenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when the dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in accurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To this end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we introduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty based on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem. This explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer and better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and retain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our final model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that ThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%, using only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation. This significantly outperforms all existing 7B-level reasoning VLMs, and our fairly comparable baselines that use classic selection methods such as accuracy-based filtering. Notably, on MathVista, ThinkLite-VL-7B achieves the SoTA accuracy of 75.1, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL-72B, GPT-4o, and O1. Our code, data, and model are available at https://github.com/si0wang/ThinkLite-VL.</p></details> |

Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.</p></details> |

We apply our method to build the first knowledge graph of nuclear fusion energy, a highly specialized field characterized by vast scope and heterogeneity. This is an ideal benchmark to test the key features of our pipeline, including automatic named entity recognition and entity resolution. We show how pre-trained large language models can be used to address these challenges and we evaluate their performance against Zipf's law, which characterizes human-generated natural language. Additionally, we develop a knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation system that combines large language models with a multi-prompt approach. This system provides contextually relevant answers to natural-language queries, including complex multi-hop questions that require reasoning across interconnected entities.</p></details> |
| **11** | **[Distilling Knowledge from Heterogeneous Architectures for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07691v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation focus on guiding the student to imitate the teacher's knowledge within homogeneous architectures. However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating distillation between heterogeneous architectures.</p></details> |
| **12** | **[Alice: Proactive Learning with Teacher's Demonstrations for Weak-to-Strong Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07316v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) present a key challenge of maintaining effective human oversight. Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) offers a promising framework for supervising increasingly capable LLMs using weaker ones. Traditional W2SG methods rely on passive learning, where a weak teacher provides noisy demonstrations to train a strong student. This hinders students from employing their knowledge during training and reaching their full potential. In this work, we introduce Alice (pro{A}ctive {l}earning w{i}th tea{c}her's D{e}monstrations), a framework that leverages complementary knowledge between teacher and student to enhance the learning process.We probe the knowledge base of the teacher model by eliciting their uncertainty, and then use these insights together with teachers' responses as demonstrations to guide student models in self-generating improved responses for supervision. In addition, for situations with significant capability gaps between teacher and student models, we introduce cascade Alice, which employs a hierarchical training approach where weak teachers initially supervise intermediate models, who then guide stronger models in sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the W2SG performance, yielding substantial improvements in three key tasks compared to the original W2SG: knowledge-based reasoning (+4.0%), mathematical reasoning (+22.62%), and logical reasoning (+12.11%). This highlights the effectiveness of our new W2SG paradigm that enables more robust knowledge transfer and supervision outcome.</p></details> |

There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets and aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.</p></details> |

While traditional machine learning methods, such as gradient boosting, often outperform deep learning approaches, recent advancements in neural architectures offer promising alternatives. This paper introduces TabKAN, a novel framework that advances tabular data modeling using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike conventional deep learning models, KANs leverage learnable activation functions on edges, enhancing both interpretability and training efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) the introduction of modular KAN-based architectures tailored for tabular data analysis, (2) the development of a transfer learning framework for KAN models, enabling effective knowledge transfer between domains, (3) the development of model-specific interpretability for tabular data learning, reducing reliance on post hoc and model-agnostic analysis, and (4) comprehensive evaluation of vanilla supervised learning across binary and multi-class classification tasks. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse public datasets, TabKAN demonstrates superior performance in supervised learning while significantly outperforming classical and Transformer-based models in transfer learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the advantage of KAN-based architectures in efficiently transferring knowledge across domains, bridging the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning for structured data.</p></details> |

These approaches struggle to efficiently capture the complex connections in real-world knowledge graphs, thereby limiting their overall performance. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware multimodal Diffusion model for multimodal knowledge graph Completion (DiffusionCom). DiffusionCom innovatively approaches the problem from the perspective of generative models, modeling the association between the $(head, relation)$ pair and candidate tail entities as their joint probability distribution $p((head, relation), (tail))$, and framing the MKGC task as a process of gradually generating the joint probability distribution from noise. Furthermore, to fully leverage the structural information in MKGs, we propose Structure-MKGformer, an adaptive and structure-aware multimodal knowledge representation learning method, as the encoder for DiffusionCom. Structure-MKGformer captures rich structural information through a multimodal graph attention network (MGAT) and adaptively fuses it with entity representations, thereby enhancing the structural awareness of these representations. This design effectively addresses the limitations of existing MKGC methods, particularly those based on multimodal pre-trained models, in utilizing structural information. DiffusionCom is trained using both generative and discriminative losses for the generator, while the feature extractor is optimized exclusively with discriminative loss. This dual approach allows DiffusionCom to harness the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. Extensive experiments on the FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG datasets demonstrate that DiffusionCom outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |

The difficulty arises from several factors. First, the sheer number of potential outcomes stemming from even a single position, starting from the initial setup, makes forecasting a player's next move incredibly complex. Second, and perhaps even more challenging, is the inherent unpredictability of human behavior. Unlike the optimized play of engines, humans introduce a layer of variability due to differing playing styles and decision-making processes. Each player approaches the game with a unique blend of strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and psychological tendencies, leading to diverse and often unexpected actions. This stylistic variation, combined with the capacity for creativity and even irrational moves, makes predicting human play difficult. Chess, a longstanding benchmark of artificial intelligence research, has seen significant advancements in tools and automation. Engines like Deep Blue, AlphaZero, and Stockfish can defeat even the most skilled human players. However, despite their exceptional ability to outplay top-level grandmasters, predicting the moves of non-grandmaster players, who comprise most of the global chess community -- remains complicated for these engines. This paper proposes a novel approach combining expert knowledge with machine learning techniques to predict human players' next moves. By applying feature engineering grounded in domain expertise, we seek to uncover the patterns in the moves of intermediate-level chess players, particularly during the opening phase of the game. Our methodology offers a promising framework for anticipating human behavior, advancing both the fields of AI and human-computer interaction.</p></details> |
| **17** | **[Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05050v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |
| **18** | **[Universal Item Tokenization for Transferable Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.</p></details> |

While drones assist inspections, they overlook the interplay between personality traits, stress management, and operational strategies expert engineers employ. This gap, combined with workforce shortages, necessitates effective knowledge transfer. This study proposes a VR-based training system for human-drone interaction in building heat loss inspection. Participants piloted a virtual drone with a thermographic monitor to identify defects. By analyzing flight patterns, stress adaptation, and inspection performance across diverse trainees, we found: (1) Flight Trajectories - Extraverts, Intuitives, Feelers, and Perceivers explored larger areas but showed higher misclassification rates, while Introverts, Sensors, Thinkers, and Judgers demonstrated methodical approaches. (2) Stress Adaptation - Heart rate variability revealed broader stress fluctuations among Extraverts, Intuitives, Feelers, and Perceivers, whereas Introverts, Sensors, Thinkers, and Judgers maintained steadier responses. Task complexity magnified these differences. (3) Inspection Performance - Extraverts, Intuitives, and Feelers achieved higher recall but over-identified defects. Introverts, Sensors, Thinkers, and Judgers made fewer random errors but risked overlooking subtle heat losses. These insights highlight the interplay among personality traits, stress management, and operational strategies in VR training for drone-assisted audits. The framework shows potential for addressing workforce shortages by facilitating knowledge transfer and optimizing human-drone collaboration.</p></details> |

The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[F-ViTA: Foundation Model Guided Visible to Thermal Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02801v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Thermal imaging is crucial for scene understanding, particularly in low-light and nighttime conditions. However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly and labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared image capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored visible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a style transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the modality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited training data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that leverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide the diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an InstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation models such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful correlations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared imagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, our model generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and can generate Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), and Near-Infrared (NIR) translations from the same visible image.

| **22** | **[Affordable AI Assistants with Knowledge Graph of Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02670v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini, while reducing costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for recent reasoning models are similar, e.g., 36% and 37.5% for Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B, respectively. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.</p></details> |

While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by linear vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.</p></details> |

Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.</p></details> |
| **25** | **[A Diffusion-Based Framework for Occluded Object Movement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01873v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Seamlessly moving objects within a scene is a common requirement for image editing, but it is still a challenge for existing editing methods. Especially for real-world images, the occlusion situation further increases the difficulty. The main difficulty is that the occluded portion needs to be completed before movement can proceed. To leverage the real-world knowledge embedded in the pre-trained diffusion models, we propose a Diffusion-based framework specifically designed for Occluded Object Movement, named DiffOOM. The proposed DiffOOM consists of two parallel branches that perform object de-occlusion and movement simultaneously. The de-occlusion branch utilizes a background color-fill strategy and a continuously updated object mask to focus the diffusion process on completing the obscured portion of the target object. Concurrently, the movement branch employs latent optimization to place the completed object in the target location and adopts local text-conditioned guidance to integrate the object into new surroundings appropriately. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which is further validated by a comprehensive user study.</p></details> |

While advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a highly promising solution, enabling AI to emulate human-like scientific discovery remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose AI-Newton, a concept-driven discovery system capable of autonomously deriving physical laws from raw data -- without supervision or prior physical knowledge. The system integrates a knowledge base and knowledge representation centered on physical concepts, along with an autonomous discovery workflow. As a proof of concept, we apply AI-Newton to a large set of Newtonian mechanics problems. Given experimental data with noise, the system successfully rediscovers fundamental laws, including Newton's second law, energy conservation and law of gravitation, using autonomously defined concepts. This achievement marks a significant step toward AI-driven autonomous scientific discovery.</p></details> |
| **27** | **[Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01403v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a unified multitask learning framework that combines these two types of labels and is thus able to be trained on multiple datasets. This framework uses an effective input representation that combines musical features (i.e., key and chords) and MERT embeddings. Moreover, knowledge distillation is employed to transfer the knowledge of teacher models trained on individual datasets to a student model, enhancing its ability to generalize across multiple tasks. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic. According to our experimental results, the inclusion of musical features, multitask learning, and knowledge distillation significantly enhances performance. In particular, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition on the MTG-Jamendo dataset. Our work makes a significant contribution to MER by allowing the combination of categorical and dimensional emotion labels in one unified framework, thus enabling training across datasets.</p></details> |

To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.</p></details> |

However, previous synthetic approaches struggle to easily scale up data and incur high costs in the pursuit of high quality. In this paper, we propose the Graph-based Synthetic Data Pipeline (GSDP), an economical and scalable framework for high-quality reasoning data synthesis. Inspired by knowledge graphs, we extracted knowledge points from seed data and constructed a knowledge point relationships graph to explore their interconnections. By exploring the implicit relationships among knowledge, our method achieves $\times$255 data expansion. Furthermore, GSDP led by open-source models, achieves synthesis quality comparable to GPT-4-0613 while maintaining $\times$100 lower costs. To tackle the most challenging mathematical reasoning task, we present the GSDP-MATH dataset comprising over 1.91 million pairs of math problems and answers. After fine-tuning on GSDP-MATH, GSDP-7B based on Mistral-7B achieves 37.7% accuracy on MATH and 78.4% on GSM8K, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and models will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/GSDP.</p></details> |

However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach \textbf{Design2GarmentCode} based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.</p></details> |

Humor is a culturally nuanced aspect of human language, presenting challenges for its understanding and generation. Humor generation necessitates a multi-hop reasoning process, with each hop founded on proper rationales. Although many studies, such as those related to GPT-o1, focus on logical reasoning with reflection and correction, they still fall short in humor generation. Due to the sparsity of the knowledge graph in creative thinking, it is arduous to achieve multi-hop reasoning. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a more robust framework for addressing the humor reasoning task, named LoL. LoL aims to inject external information to mitigate the sparsity of the knowledge graph, thereby enabling multi-hop reasoning. In the first stage of LoL, we put forward an automatic instruction-evolution method to incorporate the deeper and broader thinking processes underlying humor. Judgment-oriented instructions are devised to enhance the model's judgment capability, dynamically supplementing and updating the sparse knowledge graph. Subsequently, through reinforcement learning, the reasoning logic for each online-generated response is extracted using GPT-4o. In this process, external knowledge is re-introduced to aid the model in logical reasoning and the learning of human preferences. Finally, experimental results indicate that the combination of these two processes can enhance both the model's judgment ability and its generative capacity. These findings deepen our comprehension of the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and offer approaches to boost LLMs' creative abilities for cross-domain innovative applications.</p></details> |

Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</p></details> |

For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.</p></details> |

Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p></details> |

However, they face persistent challenges such as data sparsity and heterogeneity, largely due to isolated client environments. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs), particularly large language models like ChatGPT, present an opportunity to surmount these issues through powerful, cross-task knowledge transfer. In this position paper, we systematically examine the convergence of FRSs and FMs, illustrating how FM-enhanced frameworks can substantially improve client-side personalization, communication efficiency, and server-side aggregation. We also delve into pivotal challenges introduced by this integration, including privacy-security trade-offs, non-IID data, and resource constraints in federated setups, and propose prospective research directions in areas such as multimodal recommendation, real-time FM adaptation, and explainable federated reasoning. By unifying FRSs with FMs, our position paper provides a forward-looking roadmap for advancing privacy-preserving, high-performance recommendation systems that fully leverage large-scale pre-trained knowledge to enhance local performance.</p></details> |

A popular approach to UCR is to fine-tune language models with external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), but this usually requires a large number of training examples. In this paper, we propose to transform the downstream multiple choice question answering task into a simpler binary classification task by ranking all candidate answers according to their reasonableness. To this end, for training the model, we convert the knowledge graph triples into reasonable and unreasonable texts. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on various multiple choice question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, compared with existing UCR approaches using KGs, ours is less data hungry. Our code is available at https://github.com/probe2/BUCA.</p></details> |

From experimental results, we find relevance to graph theory, matrix representation, and mathematical consciousness. We prove that the decision strategy of movement for Xi Gua Qi and Chinese checker games belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group over set Y={-1,0,1}. Additionally, the movement for any board game with two players belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group from the razor of Occam. We derive the closed form of the transition matrix for any board game with two players such as chess and Chinese chess. We discover that the element of the transition matrix belongs to a rational number. We propose a different methodology based on algebra theory to analyze the complexity of board games in their entirety, instead of being limited solely to endgame results. It is probable that similar decision processes of people may also belong to a matrix representation that is neither a ring nor a group.</p></details> |

While virtual reality (VR) is promising for older adults to socialize remotely, existing social VR designs primarily focus on verbal communication (e.g., reminiscent, chat). Actively engaging in shared activities is also an important aspect of social connection. We designed RemoteChess, which constructs a social community and a culturally relevant activity (i.e., Chinese chess) for older adults to play while engaging in social interaction. We conducted a user study with groups of older adults interacting with each other through RemoteChess. Our findings indicate that RemoteChess enhanced participants' social connectedness by offering familiar environments, culturally relevant social catalysts, and asymmetric interactions. We further discussed design guidelines for designing culturally relevant social activities in VR to promote social connectedness for older adults.</p></details> |

The partizan ruleset {\sc Robin Hood} is an instance of a Cumulative Game, viz., {\sc Wealth Nim}. It is played on multiple heaps, each associated with a pair of cumulations, interpreted here as wealth. Each player chooses one of the heaps, removes tokens from that heap not exceeding their own wealth, while simultaneously diminishing the other player's wealth by the same amount. In CGT, the {\em temperature} of a {\em disjunctive sum} game component is an estimate of the urgency of moving first in that component. It turns out that most of the positions of {\sc Robin Hood} are {\em hot}. The temperature of {\sc Robin Hood} on a single large heap shows a dichotomy in behavior depending on the ratio of the wealths of the players. Interestingly, this bifurcation is related to Pingala (Fibonacci) sequences and the Golden Ratio $\phi$: when the ratio of the wealths lies in the interval $(\phi^{-1},\phi)$, the temperature increases linearly with the heap size, and otherwise it remains constant, and the mean values has a reciprocal property. It turns out that despite {\sc Robin Hood} displaying high temperatures, playing in the hottest component might be a sub-optimal strategy.</p></details> |

(''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Complete Implementation of WXF Chinese Chess Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17334v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Unlike repetitions in Western Chess where all repetitions are draws, repetitions in Chinese Chess could result in a win, draw, or loss depending on the kind of repetition being made by both players. One of the biggest hurdles facing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging games correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF rules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce several novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without compromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and we saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an increased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.</p></details> |

Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</p></details> |

Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</p></details> |

One of the major approaches to analyzing games in combinatorial game theory is to break down a given game position into a disjunctive sum of multiple sub-positions, then evaluate the game value of each component of the sum, and finally integrate these game values to find which player has a winning strategy in the whole position. Accordingly, finding the game value of a given position is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. The sequential compound proposed by Stromquist and Ullman is a combinatorial game consisting of two combinatorial games. In the sequential compound of games $G$ and $H$, the players make moves on $G$ until $G$ is over, and then they play on $H$. In this paper, we investigate the general properties of sequential compounds. As the main result, we give the game values of sequential compounds of a finite number of integers and stars, which are basic and typical games in combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(k log n), and this time complexity is on a par with the existing O(k log n) algorithm. We do not have any recursion overhead or stack overflow because we do not use any recursion. Therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1), and ours is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm in this respect. When k is small and n is large, our algorithm is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm. This new algorithm is based on a relation between the Josephus problem and a maximum Nim of combinatorial game theory.</p></details> |

This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1\% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold. The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p></details> |

Our focus lies on finding optimal picking strategies that facilitate an effective coordination of a multi-robot system, subject to maximizing the waste removal potential. We realize this by formulating the sorting problem as an OpenAI gym environment and training a neural network with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The objective function is set up to optimize the picking rate of the robotic system. In simulation, we draw a performance comparison to an intuitive combinatorial game theory-based approach. We show that the trained policies outperform the latter and achieve up to 16% higher picking rates. Finally, the respective algorithms are validated on a hardware setup consisting of a two-robot sorting station able to process incoming waste objects through pick-and-place operations.</p></details> |

The unique attribute of XQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically, optimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on which it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to significantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local illegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional input, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations reveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its performance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's success in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific range. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV model imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi engines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the inherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic Xiangqi players.</p></details> |

In combinatorial game theory, the temperature of a position is a measure of the urgency of moving first. It is known that the temperature of \snort in general is infinite ($K_{1,n}$ has temperature $n$). We show that the temperature in addition can be infinitely larger than the degree of the board being played on. We do so by constructing a family of positions in which the temperature grows twice as fast as the degree of the board.</p></details> |

The research on recommended sequences of moves in each opening of shogi is called joseki; how to use a rook (Static Rook and Ranging Rook), or how to develop a castle, etc. Also, many pieces of tsume shogi, artistic shogi miniature problems, in which the opponent's king is checkmated by a series of checks, have been created involving various beautiful techniques such as "saw" and "puzzle ring". In addition, the rapid development of AI in recent years has led to the pursuit of the best possible moves in shogi. In this paper, we move away from the study of winning and losing in shogi and focus on the mathematical aspects of the movement of shogi pieces. We propose to correspond movements of shogi pieces to a set of geometrical patterns constructed by the shape of shogi pieces and representing the Frieze group through the condition regarding the neighborhood of arrangements of given shogi pieces. Although the discovery of this correspondence does not lead to a winning strategy for shogi, however, it does demonstrate a curious involvement between the traditional Japanese board game and Western mathematics.</p></details> |

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

First, we propose an n-tuple network to extract features, since n-tuple networks require very little expert knowledge through its large numbers of features, while simulta-neously allowing easy access. Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT. Experiments show that with the same features and the same Chinese chess program, the automatically tuned comparison training feature weights achieved a win rate of 86.58% against the weights that were hand-tuned. The above trained version was then improved by adding additional features, most importantly n-tuple features.

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android code poses unique challenges for analysis, primarily due to its large volume of functions and the frequent absence of meaningful function names. This paper presents Cama, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis tasks. Cama specifies structured model outputs (comprising function summaries, refined function names, and maliciousness scores) to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics, consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance, enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset consisting of 118 Android malware samples, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use Cama to evaluate four popular open-source models. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of Code LLMs in malware analysis tasks.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Enhancing the Robustness of LLM-Generated Code: Empirical Study and Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20197v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability. However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.</p></details> |

It is still challenging to build a code LLM with comprehensive performance yet ultimate efficiency. Many attempts have been released in the open source community to break the trade-off between performance and efficiency, such as the Qwen Coder series and the DeepSeek Coder series. This paper introduces yet another attempt in this area, namely Ling-Coder-Lite. We leverage the efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture along with a set of high-quality data curation methods (especially those based on program analytics) to build an efficient yet powerful code LLM. Ling-Coder-Lite exhibits on-par performance on 12 representative coding benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models of similar size, such as Qwen2.5-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite, while offering competitive latency and throughput. In practice, we achieve a 50\% reduction in deployment resources compared to the similar-sized dense model without performance loss. To facilitate further research and development in this area, we open-source our models as well as a substantial portion of high-quality data for the annealing and post-training stages.

To evaluate the robustness of content moderation, several metamorphic testing techniques have been proposed to test content moderation software. However, these techniques mainly focus on general users (e.g., text and image generation). Meanwhile, a recent study shows that developers consider using harmful keywords when naming software artifacts to be an unethical behavior. Exposure to harmful content in software artifacts can negatively impact the mental health of developers, making content moderation for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) essential. We conduct a preliminary study on program transformations that can be misused to introduce harmful content into auto-generated code, identifying 32 such transformations. To address this, we propose CHT, a coverage-guided harmfulness testing framework that generates prompts using diverse transformations and harmful keywords injected into benign programs. CHT evaluates output damage to assess potential risks in LLM-generated explanations and code. Our evaluation of four Code LLMs and GPT-4o-mini reveals that content moderation in LLM-based code generation is easily bypassed. To enhance moderation, we propose a two-phase approach that first detects harmful content before generating output, improving moderation effectiveness by 483.76\%.</p></details> |

However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in IE, a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability through IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on a translated instance prediction task we proposed. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by $30.17\%$ and SoTA by $20.03\%$, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

Extensive efforts have been made to evaluate the abilities of code LLMs in various aspects, with an increasing number of benchmarks and evaluation frameworks proposed. Apart from the most sought-after capability of code generation, the capability of code comprehension is being granted growing attention. Nevertheless, existing works assessing the code comprehension capability of LLMs exhibit varied limitations. Evaluation frameworks like CRUXEval and REval usually focus on code reasoning tasks over a certain input case, leading to a limited range of execution traces covered, resulting in a loss in code semantics examined and the inability to assess the comprehensive understanding of LLMs concerning the target program. To tackle these challenges, we propose SpecEval, a novel black-box evaluation framework to evaluate code comprehension in LLMs via program specifications. Inspired by the idea that specifications can act as a comprehensive articulation of program behaviors concerning all possible execution traces, we employ formalized program specifications to represent program semantics and perform comprehensive evaluations. In particular, four specification-related tasks are designed meticulously to assess the capability of LLMs from basic to advanced levels. Counterfactual analysis is further conducted to study the performance variance of LLMs under semantics-preserving perturbations. Systematic experiments are conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs. Extensive experimental results present a below-satisfactory performance of LLMs on specification-related tasks, revealing the limitations of existing LLMs in terms of articulating program semantics with formal specifications. Counterfactual analysis also reveals the sensitivity of LLMs towards semantic-preserving perturbations.</p></details> |

However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</p></details> |

| **2** | **[Visual-Aware Speech Recognition for Noisy Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07229v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Humans have the ability to utilize visual cues, such as lip movements and visual scenes, to enhance auditory perception, particularly in noisy environments. However, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models often struggle in noisy scenarios. To solve this task, we propose a model that improves transcription by correlating noise sources to visual cues. Unlike works that rely on lip motion and require the speaker's visibility, we exploit broader visual information from the environment. This allows our model to naturally filter speech from noise and improve transcription, much like humans do in noisy scenarios. Our method re-purposes pretrained speech and visual encoders, linking them with multi-headed attention. This approach enables the transcription of speech and the prediction of noise labels in video inputs. We introduce a scalable pipeline to develop audio-visual datasets, where visual cues correlate to noise in the audio. We show significant improvements over existing audio-only models in noisy scenarios. Results also highlight that visual cues play a vital role in improved transcription accuracy.</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce novel loss functions to mitigate the impact of transcription errors in RNN-Transducer models. Our Star-Transducer loss addresses deletion errors by incorporating "skip frame" transitions in the loss lattice, restoring over 90% of the system's performance compared to models trained with accurate transcripts. The Bypass-Transducer loss uses "skip token" transitions to tackle insertion errors, recovering more than 60% of the quality. Finally, the Target-Robust Transducer loss merges these approaches, offering robust performance against arbitrary errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the Target-Robust Transducer loss significantly improves RNN-T performance on noisy data by restoring over 70% of the quality compared to well-transcribed data.</p></details> |

By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

The optimal order of tensor contractions can then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training efficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the depthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices will take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group convolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the Centaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network size and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during both training and inference. We show that this heterogeneous network design outperforms its homogeneous counterparts in raw audio processing tasks including keyword spotting, speech denoising, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). For ASR, Centaurus is the first network with competitive performance that can be made fully state-space based, without using any nonlinear recurrence (LSTMs), explicit convolutions (CNNs), or (surrogate) attention mechanism.

However, reading mathematical expressions aloud without accompanying visuals can significantly hinder comprehension, especially for those who are hearing-impaired or rely on subtitles due to language barriers. For instance, when a presenter reads Euler's Formula, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often produce a verbose and error-prone textual description (e.g., e to the power of i x equals cosine of x plus i $\textit{side}$ of x), instead of the concise $\LaTeX{}$ format (i.e., $ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) $), which hampers clear understanding and communication. To address this issue, we introduce MathSpeech, a novel pipeline that integrates ASR models with small Language Models (sLMs) to correct errors in mathematical expressions and accurately convert spoken expressions into structured $\LaTeX{}$ representations. Evaluated on a new dataset derived from lecture recordings, MathSpeech demonstrates $\LaTeX{}$ generation capabilities comparable to leading commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), while leveraging fine-tuned small language models of only 120M parameters. Specifically, in terms of CER, BLEU, and ROUGE scores for $\LaTeX{}$ translation, MathSpeech demonstrated significantly superior capabilities compared to GPT-4o. We observed a decrease in CER from 0.390 to 0.298, and higher ROUGE/BLEU scores compared to GPT-4o.</p></details> |

However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance.

While significant progress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of audio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts or in subtle ways, presents highly challenging detection scenarios. To address these challenges, we present DiMoDif, an audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages the inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the assumption that in real samples -- in contrast to deepfakes -- visual and audio signals coincide in terms of information. DiMoDif leverages features from deep networks that specialize in visual and audio speech recognition to spot frame-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize the deepfake forgery. To this end, we devise a hierarchical cross-modal fusion network, integrating adaptive temporal alignment modules and a learned discrepancy mapping layer to explicitly model the subtle differences between visual and audio representations. Then, the detection model is optimized through a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and fake intervals localization. DiMoDif outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Deepfake Detection task by 30.5 AUC on the highly challenging AV-Deepfake1M, while it performs exceptionally on FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF. On the Temporal Forgery Localization task, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 47.88 AP@0.75 on AV-Deepfake1M, and performs on-par on LAV-DF.

However, existing methods focus solely on predicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands are visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that approximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the camera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D trajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out of the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for Egocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation sequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both hands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing other joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and body joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate EgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand annotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences, respectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the baseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand pose forecasting.

Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals. The dataset and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/RISELabPurdue/MBE-ARI/, inviting further exploration and development in this critical area.</p></details> |

Their novelty compared to standard cameras lies in the transition from capturing full picture frames at fixed time intervals to a sparse data format which, with its distinctive qualities, offers potential improvements in various applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of reinventing algorithmic procedures or adapting them to effectively process the new data format. In this survey, we systematically examine neuromorphic vision along three main dimensions. First, we highlight the technological evolution and distinctive hardware features of neuromorphic cameras from their inception to recent models. Second, we review image processing algorithms developed explicitly for event-based data, covering key works on feature detection, tracking, and optical flow -which form the basis for analyzing image elements and transformations -as well as depth and pose estimation or object recognition, which interpret more complex scene structures and components. These techniques, drawn from classical computer vision and modern data-driven approaches, are examined to illustrate the breadth of applications for event-based cameras. Third, we present practical application case studies demonstrating how event cameras have been successfully used across various industries and scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges limiting widespread adoption, identify significant research gaps compared to standard imaging techniques, and outline promising future directions and opportunities that neuromorphic vision offers.</p></details> |

Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.</p></details> |

Existing pose datasets often simplify the spine to a single rigid segment, overlooking the nuanced articulation required for accurate motion analysis. In contrast, SpineTrack annotates nine detailed spinal keypoints across two complementary subsets: a synthetic set comprising 25k annotations created using Unreal Engine with biomechanical alignment through OpenSim, and a real-world set comprising over 33k annotations curated via an active learning pipeline that iteratively refines automated annotations with human feedback. This integrated approach ensures anatomically consistent labels at scale, even for challenging, in-the-wild images. We further introduce SpinePose, extending state-of-the-art body pose estimators using knowledge distillation and an anatomical regularization strategy to jointly predict body and spine keypoints. Our experiments in both general and sports-specific contexts validate the effectiveness of SpineTrack for precise spine pose estimation, establishing a robust foundation for future research in advanced biomechanical analysis and 3D spine reconstruction in the wild.</p></details> |

While existing methods can estimate the poses of unseen objects, their generalization ability remains limited in scenarios involving occlusions and sparse reference views, restricting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce corner points of the object bounding box as an intermediate representation of the object pose. The 3D object corners can be reliably recovered from sparse input views, while the 2D corner points in the target view are estimated through a novel reference-based point synthesizer, which works well even in scenarios involving occlusions. As object semantic points, object corners naturally establish 2D-3D correspondences for object pose estimation with a PnP algorithm. Extensive experiments on the YCB-Video and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and significantly enhancing the generalization capabilities of object pose estimation, which is crucial for real-world applications.</p></details> |

However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter stable static points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Improving Indoor Localization Accuracy by Using an Efficient Implicit Neural Map Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23480v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Globally localizing a mobile robot in a known map is often a foundation for enabling robots to navigate and operate autonomously. In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization. The code of our approach is available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/enm-mcl.</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on synthetic pretraining and struggle to generate smooth and accurate predictions in real-world settings, particularly for lower limbs. Our work addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight VR-based data collection setup with on-board, real-time 6D pose tracking. Using this setup, we collected the most extensive real-world dataset for ego-facing ego-mounted cameras to date in size and motion variability. Effectively integrating this multimodal input -- device pose and camera feeds -- is challenging due to the differing characteristics of each data source. To address this, we propose FRAME, a simple yet effective architecture that combines device pose and camera feeds for state-of-the-art body pose prediction through geometrically sound multimodal integration and can run at 300 FPS on modern hardware. Lastly, we showcase a novel training strategy to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Our approach exploits the problem's geometric properties, yielding high-quality motion capture free from common artifacts in prior works. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations, along with extensive comparisons, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Data, code, and CAD designs will be available at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/FRAME/</p></details> |

The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</p></details> |

Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.</p></details> |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |

Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as a promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper, we present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively loosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry, RINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint extraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive voting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time optimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar module's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter framework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains the global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also dynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during fusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and 0.09{\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, RINO achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

Prior works in speeding up the optimization have limitations on optimizing MPC running time directly and generalizing to hold out domains. To overcome this challenge, we develop a novel framework aiming at expediting optimization processes directly. In our framework, we combine offline self-supervised learning and online fine-tuning to improve the control performance and reduce optimization time. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel and challenging Formula 1 track driving task. Comparing to single-phase training, our approach achieves a 19.4\% reduction in optimization time and a 6.3\% improvement in tracking accuracy on zero-shot tracks.</p></details> |

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object.

For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant.

A particular focus in computer-assisted surgery is to replace marker-based tracking systems for instrument localization with pure image-based 6DoF pose estimation using deep-learning methods. However, state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation methods do not yet meet the accuracy required for surgical navigation. In this context, we investigate the benefits of multi-view setups for highly accurate and occlusion-robust 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and derive recommendations for an ideal camera system that addresses the challenges in the operating room. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present a multi-camera capture setup consisting of static and head-mounted cameras, which allows us to study the performance of pose estimation methods under various camera configurations. Second, we publish a multi-view RGB-D video dataset of ex-vivo spine surgeries, captured in a surgical wet lab and a real operating theatre and including rich annotations for surgeon, instrument, and patient anatomy. Third, we evaluate three state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view methods for the task of 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and analyze the influence of camera configurations, training data, and occlusions on the pose accuracy and generalization ability. The best method utilizes five cameras in a multi-view pose optimization and achieves an average position and orientation error of 1.01 mm and 0.89{\deg} for a surgical drill as well as 2.79 mm and 3.33{\deg} for a screwdriver under optimal conditions. Our results demonstrate that marker-less tracking of surgical instruments is becoming a feasible alternative to existing marker-based systems.</p></details> |
| **21** | **[Unifying Tracking and Image-Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11077v2)** | 2022-11-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Objection detection (OD) has been one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.</p></details> |

The proposed method uses self-supervised learning (SSL) models to extract features from NVs and uses a classifier chain to model the label dependency between emotions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of this task compared to several baseline methods. Our proposed method obtained a mean concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of $0.725$ in the validation set and $0.739$ in the test set, while the best baseline method only obtained $0.554$ in the validation set.

Specifically, we formulate the challenge to adapt an average TTS model to the stylistic target voice with limited data from target speaker, evaluated by speaker identity and style similarity. The challenge consists of two tracks, namely few-shot track and one-shot track, where the participants are required to clone multiple target voices with 100 and 5 samples respectively. There are also two sub-tracks in each track. For sub-track a, to fairly compare different strategies, the participants are allowed to use only the training data provided by the organizer strictly. For sub-track b, the participants are allowed to use any data publicly available. In this paper, we present a detailed explanation on the tasks and data used in the challenge, followed by a summary of submitted systems and evaluation results.</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Gen3DEval, a novel evaluation framework that leverages vision large language models (vLLMs) specifically fine-tuned for 3D object quality assessment. Gen3DEval evaluates text fidelity, appearance, and surface quality by analyzing 3D surface normals, without requiring ground-truth comparisons, bridging the gap between automated metrics and user preferences. Compared to state-of-the-art task-agnostic models, Gen3DEval demonstrates superior performance in user-aligned evaluations, placing it as a comprehensive and accessible benchmark for future research on text-to-3D generation.

Recent advances in 3D content generation have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which contains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although Objaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is limited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation, we manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including aesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object composition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural network capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset. Through experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that models pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance than those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation tasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by our tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the training loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich annotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more efficient path to develop 3D generative models. We release our enhanced dataset of approximately 500,000 curated 3D models to facilitate further research on various downstream tasks in 3D computer vision. In the near future, we aim to extend our annotations to cover the entire Objaverse dataset.</p></details> |

We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization. As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Stochastic Ray Tracing of 3D Transparent Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting has recently been widely adopted as a 3D representation for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and text-to-3D generation tasks, offering realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussians carrying opacities and view-dependent colors. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the 3D Gaussians with approximate sorting per view or rely on high-end RTX GPUs to exhaustively process all ray-Gaussian intersections (bounding Gaussians by meshes). This paper proposes a stochastic ray tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or N intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids sorting the Gaussians along the ray while minimizing the register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. While our method introduces noise, the shading is unbiased, and the variance is slight, as stochastic acceptance is importance-sampled based on accumulated opacity. The alignment with the Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and easily integrates our method into a conventional path-tracing framework.</p></details> |

Although some recent attempts have explored such compositional scenarios, they still require an extensive process of optimizing the entire layout, which is highly cumbersome if not infeasible at all. To overcome these challenges, we propose Flash Sculptor in this paper, a simple yet effective framework for compositional 3D scene/object reconstruction from a single image. At the heart of Flash Sculptor lies a divide-and-conquer strategy, which decouples compositional scene reconstruction into a sequence of sub-tasks, including handling the appearance, rotation, scale, and translation of each individual instance. Specifically, for rotation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine scheme that brings the best of both worlds--efficiency and accuracy--while for translation, we develop an outlier-removal-based algorithm that ensures robust and precise parameters in a single step, without any iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Flash Sculptor achieves at least a 3 times speedup over existing compositional 3D methods, while setting new benchmarks in compositional 3D reconstruction performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/Flash-Sculptor.</p></details> |

Recent advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of architectural design and data scaling.

And the approaches and advantages of memory-efficient data formats and storage techniques for such datasets vary. OpenVDB library and its VDB data format excels in memory efficiency through its hierarchical and dynamic tree structure, with active and inactive sub-trees for data storage. It is heavily used in current production renderers for both animation and rendering stages in VFX pipelines and photorealistic rendering of volumes and fluids. However, it still remains to be fully leveraged in SciVis where domains dealing with sparse scalar fields like porous media, time varying volumes such as tornado and weather simulation or high resolution simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics present ample number of large challenging data sets.Goal of this paper is not only to explore the use of OpenVDB in SciVis but also to explore a level of detail(LOD) technique using 3D Gaussian particles approximating voxel regions. For rendering, we utilize NVIDIA OptiX library for ray marching through the Gaussians particles. Data modeling using 3D Gaussians has been very popular lately due to success in stereoscopic image to 3D scene conversion using Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian approximation and mixture models aren't entirely new in SciVis as well. Our work explores the integration with rendering software libraries like OpenVDB and OptiX to take advantage of their built-in memory compaction and hardware acceleration features, while also leveraging the performance capabilities of modern GPUs. Thus, we present a SciVis rendering approach that uses 3D Gaussians at varying LOD in a lossy scheme derived from VDB datasets, rather than focusing on photorealistic volume rendering.</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.</p></details> |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.</p></details> |

However, existing works still struggle to maintain consistency between the generated views and the input views, especially when there is a significant camera pose difference, leading to poor-quality 3D geometries and textures. We attribute this issue to their treatment of all target views with equal priority according to our empirical observation that the target views closer to the input views exhibit higher fidelity. With this inspiration, we propose AR-1-to-3, a novel next-view prediction paradigm based on diffusion models that first generates views close to the input views, which are then utilized as contextual information to progressively synthesize farther views. To encode the generated view subsequences as local and global conditions for the next-view prediction, we accordingly develop a stacked local feature encoding strategy (Stacked-LE) and an LSTM-based global feature encoding strategy (LSTM-GE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency between the generated views and the input views, producing high-fidelity 3D assets.</p></details> |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> |

However, current methods usually focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D objects, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter settings at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for procedural 3D models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural models. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to generate texture for the shape produced by one setting of the procedural parameters, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other parameter settings. We also develop several techniques, including a novel UV displacement network for real-time texture transfer, the retexturing pipeline to support structural changes from discrete procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of professional procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting real-time, interactive applications.</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p></details> |

Existing text-to-3D methods often struggle to generate assets with plausible object interactions or require tedious optimization processes. To address these challenges, our approach leverages 2D layouts as a blueprint to facilitate precise and plausible control over 3D generation. Starting with a 2D layout provided by a user or generated from a text description, we first create a coarse 3D scene using a carefully designed initialization process based on efficient reconstruction models. To enforce coherent global 3D layouts and enhance the quality of instance appearances, we propose a collision-aware layout optimization process followed by instance-wise refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that Layout-Your-3D yields more reasonable and visually appealing compositional 3D assets while significantly reducing the time required for each prompt. Additionally, Layout-Your-3D can be easily applicable to downstream tasks, such as 3D editing and object insertion.

Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a robust text-to-texture method for generating consistent and seamless textures that are well aligned with the mesh. Our method leverages state-of-the-art 2D diffusion models, including SDXL and multiple ControlNets, to capture structural features and intricate details in the generated textures. The method also employs a symmetrical view synthesis strategy combined with regional prompts for enhancing view consistency. Additionally, it introduces novel texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques, which significantly reduce the seam regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |

However, applying these models to synthesize textures for 3D geometries remains challenging due to the domain gap between 2D images and textures on a 3D surface. Early works that used a projecting-and-inpainting approach managed to preserve generation diversity but often resulted in noticeable artifacts and style inconsistencies. While recent methods have attempted to address these inconsistencies, they often introduce other issues, such as blurring, over-saturation, or over-smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel text-to-texture synthesis framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models. We first introduce a local attention reweighing mechanism in the self-attention layers to guide the model in concentrating on spatial-correlated patches across different views, thereby enhancing local details while preserving cross-view consistency. Additionally, we propose a novel latent space merge pipeline, which further ensures consistency across different viewpoints without sacrificing too much diversity. Our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques regarding texture consistency and visual quality, while delivering results much faster than distillation-based methods. Importantly, our framework does not require additional training or fine-tuning, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of models available on public platforms.</p></details> |

Experimental results on multi-view and single-view reconstruction highlight TetSphere splatting's superior mesh quality while maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views. Our code is available at https://github.com/continental/6Img-to-3D, and more examples can be found at our website here https://6Img-to-3D.GitHub.io/.</p></details> |

Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.</p></details> |

We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</p></details> |

Its software control consists of three major components, one of which is BesW. BesW is responsible for all the movements of the barrier except for pushing and pulling it. In this document, we report on the complete formal specification of BesW in mCRL2. All its behaviour has been specified, including manual and testing modes. Furthermore, all fault situations have been taken into account. The formalisation allows formal verification of all behavioural properties, formulated in the modal $\mu$-calculus, with the constraints that water levels only have a restricted number of values and not all combinations of failures of pumps and valves are allowed.</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based Program Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07642v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.</p></details> |

They introduced a distributed automata framework encompassing many different models, and proved that w.r.t. their expressive power (the graph properties they can decide) distributed automata collapse into seven equivalence classes. In this contribution, we turn our attention to the formal verification problem: Given a distributed automaton, does it decide a given graph property? We consider a fundamental instance of this question - the emptiness problem: Given a distributed automaton, does it accept any graph at all? Our main result is negative: the emptiness problem is undecidable for six of the seven equivalence classes, and trivially decidable for the remaining class.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[On Coalgebraic Product Constructions for Markov Chains and Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06592v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Verifying traces of systems is a central topic in formal verification. We study model checking of Markov chains (MCs) against temporal properties represented as (finite) automata. For instance, given an MC and a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), a simple but practically useful model checking problem asks for the probability of traces on the MC that are accepted by the DFA. A standard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given MC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on the resulting product MC. In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we first present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we cannot do product constructions for model checking. Specifically, we show that there are no coalgebraic product MCs of MCs and nondeterministic finite automata for computing the probability of the accepting traces. This no-go theorem is established via a characterisation of natural transformations between certain functors that determine the type of branching, including nondeterministic or probabilistic branching. Second, we present a coalgebraic product construction of MCs and multiset finite automata (MFAs) as a new instance within our framework. This construction addresses a model checking problem that asks for the expected number of accepting runs on MFAs over traces of MCs. The problem is reduced to solving linear equations, which is solvable in polynomial-time under a reasonable assumption that ensures the finiteness of the solution.</p></details> |

However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[BoolE: Exact Symbolic Reasoning via Boolean Equality Saturation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05577v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Boolean symbolic reasoning for gate-level netlists is a critical step in verification, logic and datapath synthesis, and hardware security. Specifically, reasoning datapath and adder tree in bit-blasted Boolean networks is particularly crucial for verification and synthesis, and challenging. Conventional approaches either fail to accurately (exactly) identify the function blocks of the designs in gate-level netlist with structural hashing and symbolic propagation, or their reasoning performance is highly sensitive to structure modifications caused by technology mapping or logic optimization. This paper introduces BoolE, an exact symbolic reasoning framework for Boolean netlists using equality saturation. BoolE optimizes scalability and performance by integrating domain-specific Boolean ruleset for term rewriting. We incorporate a novel extraction algorithm into BoolE to enhance its structural insight and computational efficiency, which adeptly identifies and captures multi-input, multi-output high-level structures (e.g., full adder) in the reconstructed e-graph. Our experiments show that BoolE surpasses state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning baselines, including the conventional functional approach (ABC) and machine learning-based method (Gamora). Specifically, we evaluated its performance on various multiplier architecture with different configurations. Our results show that BoolE identifies $3.53\times$ and $3.01\times$ more exact full adders than ABC in carry-save array and Booth-encoded multipliers, respectively. Additionally, we integrated BoolE into multiplier formal verification tasks, where it significantly accelerates the performance of traditional formal verification tools using computer algebra, demonstrated over four orders of magnitude runtime improvements.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[A 2-Categorical Bridge Between Henkin Constructions and Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem: Unifying Completeness and Compactness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03797v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present a unified categorical framework that connects the syntactic Henkin construction for the first-order Completeness Theorem with Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem. Concretely, we define two canonical functors from the category of first-order theories to the category of their models, and then introduce a canonical natural transformation that links the Henkin-based term models to semantically constructed models arising from compactness or saturation arguments. We prove that every component of this natural transformation is an isomorphism, thereby establishing a strong equivalence between the syntactic and semantic perspectives. Furthermore, we show that this transformation is 2-categorically rigid: any other natural transformation in the same setting is uniquely isomorphic to it. Our framework highlights the shared diagonalization principle underlying both Henkin's and Lawvere's methods and demonstrates concrete applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the design of advanced type-theoretic systems.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[Automated Discovery of Tactic Libraries for Interactive Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24036v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Enabling more concise and modular proofs is essential for advancing formal reasoning using interactive theorem provers (ITPs). Since many ITPs, such as Rocq and Lean, use tactic-style proofs, learning higher-level custom tactics is crucial for proof modularity and automation. This paper presents a novel approach to tactic discovery, which leverages Tactic Dependence Graphs (TDGs) to identify reusable proof strategies across multiple proofs. TDGs capture logical dependencies between tactic applications while abstracting away irrelevant syntactic details, allowing for both the discovery of new tactics and the refactoring of existing proofs into more modular forms. We have implemented this technique in a tool called TacMiner and compare it against an anti-unification-based approach Peano to tactic discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that TacMiner can learn 3x as many tactics as Peano and reduces the size of proofs by 26% across all benchmarks. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of learning custom tactics for proof automation, allowing a state-of-the-art proof automation tool to achieve a relative increase of 172% in terms of success rate.</p></details> |
| **11** | **[A Natural Transformation between the Model Constructions of the Completeness and Compactness Theorems, Enhanced by Rigidity and 2-Categorical Strengthening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16555v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this paper we present a mathematically rigorous and constructive framework that unifies two canonical model constructions in classical first order logic. In particular, we define two functors F and G from the category of consistent first order theories to the category of models. The functor F is constructed via the Henkin method, which extends any given theory to a maximal consistent theory by means of a fixed enumeration and the systematic introduction of Henkin constants, and then constructs a term model by taking the quotient of the term algebra with respect to provable equality. The functor G is obtained through a canonical compactness based construction, using either a fixed ultraproduct or a saturation procedure, ensuring that the resulting model is unique up to isomorphism. We prove the existence of a natural transformation eta from F to G such that each component is an isomorphism. Moreover, by leveraging the uniqueness of saturated (or prime) models in countable languages, we show that eta is rigid, meaning any other natural transformation between F and G must equal eta. Furthermore, we establish a strong natural equivalence between F and G in the two categorical sense, with eta and its inverse satisfying the required coherence conditions. This unification not only deepens our understanding of the interplay between proof theory and model theory, but also opens new avenues for applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the study of alternative logical systems.</p></details> |
| **12** | **[Local Look-Ahead Guidance via Verifier-in-the-Loop for Automated Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09730v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the model, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human annotated trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |

This paper presents a recipe for the simultaneous deployment of different forms of deep and shallow embeddings in classical higher-order logic, enabling not only flexible interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, but also automated faithfulness proofs between the logic embeddings. The approach, which is fruitful for logic education, research and application, is deliberately illustrated here using simple propositional modal logic. However, the work presented is conceptual in nature and not limited to such a simple logic context.</p></details> |
| **14** | **[LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof Progress Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17925v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.</p></details> |

Combinatorics, a cornerstone of mathematics, provides essential tools for analyzing discrete structures and solving optimization problems. However, its inherent complexity makes it particularly challenging for automated theorem proving (ATP) for combinatorial identities. To address this, we manually construct LeanComb, combinatorial identities benchmark in Lean, which is, to our knowledge, the first formalized theorem proving benchmark built for combinatorial identities. We develop an Automated Theorem Generator for Combinatorial Identities, ATG4CI, which combines candidate tactics suggested by a self-improving large language model with a Reinforcement Learning Tree Search approach for tactic prediction. By utilizing ATG4CI, we generate a LeanComb-Enhanced dataset comprising 260K combinatorial identities theorems, each with a complete formal proof in Lean, and experimental evaluations demonstrate that models trained on this dataset can generate more effective tactics, thereby improving success rates in automated theorem proving for combinatorial identities.</p></details> |

Previously, APPS provided a benchmark and dataset for programming puzzles to be completed in Python and checked against unit tests, of the kind seen in technical assessments in the software engineering industry. Building upon recent approaches for benchmarks in interactive theorem proving, we generalize the unit tests to Lean 4 theorems given without proof (i.e., using Lean's "sorry" keyword). On the 406 theorems of 100 randomly selected samples, Sonnet correctly proves 30% and Gemini correctly proves 18%. We challenge the machine learning and program synthesis communities to solve both each general purpose programming problem and its associated correctness specifications.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that combines large language models with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate VECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large language models with formal verification to automate program generation.</p></details> |

Deriving the most appropriate subsequent proof step, and reasoning about it, given the multitude of possibilities, remains a daunting task for novice users. To improve the situation, several investigations have developed machine learning based guidance for tactic selection. Such approaches struggle to learn non-trivial relationships between the chosen tactic and the structure of the proof state and represent them as symbolic expressions. To address these issues we (i) We represent the problem as an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) task, (ii) Using the ILP representation we enriched the feature space by encoding additional, computationally expensive properties as background knowledge predicates, (iii) We use this enriched feature space to learn rules explaining when a tactic is applicable to a given proof state, (iv) we use the learned rules to filter the output of an existing tactic selection approach and empirically show improvement over the non-filtering approaches.</p></details> |

In practice, it is mainly used for interactive theorem proving with intensional type theories, with PVS being a notable exception. In this paper, we present native rules for automated reasoning in a dependently-typed version (DHOL) of classical higher-order logic (HOL). DHOL has an extensional type theory with an undecidable type checking problem which contains theorem proving. We implemented the inference rules as well as an automatic type checking mode in Lash, a fork of Satallax, the leading tableaux-based prover for HOL. Our method is sound and complete with respect to provability in DHOL. Completeness is guaranteed by the incorporation of a sound and complete translation from DHOL to HOL recently proposed by Rothgang et al. While this translation can already be used as a preprocessing step to any HOL prover, to achieve better performance, our system directly works in DHOL. Moreover, experimental results show that the DHOL version of Lash can outperform all major HOL provers executed on the translation.</p></details> |

We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate). We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.</p></details> |

Research in the area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often complex and difficult to replicate. Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for fair and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP. We demonstrate BAIT's capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding. We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT will be a springboard for future research.</p></details> |

Yet light to major manual input from users remains most often required for obtaining the corresponding variants of theorems, when such obvious replacements are typically left implicit on paper. This article presents Trocq, a new proof transfer framework for dependent type theory. Trocq is based on a novel formulation of type equivalence, used to generalize the univalent parametricity translation. This framework takes care of avoiding dependency on the axiom of univalence when possible, and may be used with more relations than just equivalences. We have implemented a corresponding plugin for the Coq proof assistant, in the CoqElpi meta-language. We use this plugin on a gallery of representative examples of proof transfer issues in interactive theorem proving, and illustrate how Trocq covers the spectrum of several existing tools, used in program verification as well as in formalized mathematics in the broad sense.</p></details> |

Traditionally, symbolic methods that rely on extensive domain knowledge and engineering effort are applied to this task. In contrast, this work demonstrates that contrastive training with the transformer architecture can achieve higher-quality retrieval of relevant premises, without the engineering overhead. Our method, Magnushammer, outperforms the most advanced and widely used automation tool in interactive theorem proving called Sledgehammer. On the PISA and miniF2F benchmarks Magnushammer achieves $59.5\%$ (against $38.3\%$) and $34.0\%$ (against $20.9\%$) success rates, respectively. By combining \method with a language-model-based automated theorem prover, we further improve the state-of-the-art proof success rate from $57.0\%$ to $71.0\%$ on the PISA benchmark using $4$x fewer parameters. Moreover, we develop and open source a novel dataset for premise selection, containing textual representations of (proof state, relevant premise) pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available premise selection dataset, and the first one for the Isabelle proof assistant.</p></details> |
