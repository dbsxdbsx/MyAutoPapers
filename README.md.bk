| **1** | **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Microservice Deployment in Space Computing Power Networks via Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06244v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>With the growing demand for Earth observation, it is important to provide reliable real-time remote sensing inference services to meet the low-latency requirements. The Space Computing Power Network (Space-CPN) offers a promising solution by providing onboard computing and extensive coverage capabilities for real-time inference. This paper presents a remote sensing artificial intelligence applications deployment framework designed for Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations to achieve real-time inference performance. The framework employs the microservice architecture, decomposing monolithic inference tasks into reusable, independent modules to address high latency and resource heterogeneity. This distributed approach enables optimized microservice deployment, minimizing resource utilization while meeting quality of service and functional requirements. We introduce Robust Optimization to the deployment problem to address data uncertainty. Additionally, we model the Robust Optimization problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and propose a robust reinforcement learning algorithm to handle the semi-infinite Quality of Service constraints. Our approach yields sub-optimal solutions that minimize accuracy loss while maintaining acceptable computational costs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[A New Interpretation of the Certainty-Equivalence Approach for PAC Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v1)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Partially Observed Optimal Stochastic Control: Regularity, Optimality, Approximations, and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06735v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[Hierarchical Object-Oriented POMDP Planning for Object Rearrangement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01348v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We present an online planning framework for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. We evaluate our system on varying numbers of objects, rooms, and problem types in AI2-THOR simulated environments with promising results.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Near Optimal Approximations and Finite Memory Policies for POMPDs with Continuous Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02895v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>We study an approximation method for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with continuous spaces. Belief MDP reduction, which has been the standard approach to study POMDPs requires rigorous approximation methods for practical applications, due to the state space being lifted to the space of probability measures. Generalizing recent work, in this paper we present rigorous approximation methods via discretizing the observation space and constructing a fully observed finite MDP model using a finite length history of the discrete observations and control actions. We show that the resulting policy is near-optimal under some regularity assumptions on the channel, and under certain controlled filter stability requirements for the hidden state process. Furthermore, by quantizing the measurements, we are able to utilize refined filter stability conditions. We also provide a Q learning algorithm that uses a finite memory of discretized information variables, and prove its convergence to the optimality equation of the finite fully observed MDP constructed using the approximation method.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00120v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reward Machines provide an automaton-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing the underlying structure of a reward function, they enable the decomposition of an RL task, leading to impressive gains in sample efficiency. Although Reward Machines and similar formal specifications have a rich history of application towards sequential decision-making problems, they critically rely on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that forms the building blocks of the reward function--such ground-truth interpretations are elusive in the real world due in part to partial observability and noisy sensing. In this work, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that exploit task structure under uncertain interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary. Through theory and experiments, we expose pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem while simultaneously demonstrating how task structure can be successfully leveraged under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[AutoMix: Automatically Mixing Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12963v5)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now available from cloud API providers in various sizes and configurations. While this diversity offers a broad spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we present Automix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to Automix are two key technical contributions. First, it has a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring extensive training. Second, given that self-verification can be noisy, it employs a POMDP based router that can effectively select an appropriately sized model, based on answer confidence. Experiments across five language models and five challenging datasets show that Automix consistently surpasses strong baselines, reducing computational cost by over 50% for comparable performance.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Experimental Study on The Effect of Multi-step Deep Reinforcement Learning in POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04999v2)** | 2022-09-12 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made tremendous advances in both simulated and real-world robot control tasks in recent years. This is particularly the case for tasks that can be carefully engineered with a full state representation, and which can then be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, applying DRL strategies designed for MDPs to novel robot control tasks can be challenging, because the available observations may be a partial representation of the state, resulting in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This paper considers three popular DRL algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), invented for MDPs, and studies their performance in POMDP scenarios. While prior work has found that SAC and TD3 typically outperform PPO across a broad range of tasks that can be represented as MDPs, we show that this is not always the case, using three representative POMDP environments. Empirical studies show that this is related to multi-step bootstrapping, where multi-step immediate rewards, instead of one-step immediate reward, are used to calculate the target value estimation of an observation and action pair. We identify this by observing that the inclusion of multi-step bootstrapping in TD3 (MTD3) and SAC (MSAC) results in improved robustness in POMDP settings.</p></details> |

| **1** | **[Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01114v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p></details> |
| **2** | **[Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459v2)** | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/dyunis/subwords_as_skills}.</p></details> |
| **3** | **[Language Reward Modulation for Pretraining Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12270v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Using learned reward functions (LRFs) as a means to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has yielded some steady progress in task-complexity through the years. In this work, we question whether today's LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p></details> |
| **4** | **[Exploiting Transformer in Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Temporal Logic Motion Planning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3290511)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Automaton based approaches have enabled robots to perform various complex tasks. However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.</p></details> |
| **5** | **[A Cooperation Graph Approach for Multiagent Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03002v1)** | 2022-08-05 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) can solve complex cooperative tasks. However, the efficiency of existing MARL methods relies heavily on well-defined reward functions. Multiagent tasks with sparse reward feedback are especially challenging not only because of the credit distribution problem, but also due to the low probability of obtaining positive reward feedback. In this paper, we design a graph network called Cooperation Graph (CG). The Cooperation Graph is the combination of two simple bipartite graphs, namely, the Agent Clustering subgraph (ACG) and the Cluster Designating subgraph (CDG). Next, based on this novel graph structure, we propose a Cooperation Graph Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (CG-MARL) algorithm, which can efficiently deal with the sparse reward problem in multiagent tasks. In CG-MARL, agents are directly controlled by the Cooperation Graph. And a policy neural network is trained to manipulate this Cooperation Graph, guiding agents to achieve cooperation in an implicit way. This hierarchical feature of CG-MARL provides space for customized cluster-actions, an extensible interface for introducing fundamental cooperation knowledge. In experiments, CG-MARL shows state-of-the-art performance in sparse reward multiagent benchmarks, including the anti-invasion interception task and the multi-cargo delivery task.</p></details> |
| **6** | **[Abstract Demonstrations and Adaptive Exploration for Efficient and Stable Multi-step Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAC55051.2022.9911100)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been popular in many disciplines including robotics, state-of-the-art DRL algorithms still struggle to learn long-horizon, multi-step and sparse reward tasks, such as stacking several blocks given only a task-completion reward signal. To improve learning efficiency for such tasks, this paper proposes a DRL exploration technique, termed A^2, which integrates two components inspired by human experiences: Abstract demonstrations and Adaptive exploration. A^2 starts by decomposing a complex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to learn. During training, the agent explores the environment adaptively, acting more deterministically for well-mastered subtasks and more stochastically for ill-learnt subtasks. Ablation and comparative experiments are conducted on several grid-world tasks and three robotic manipulation tasks. We demonstrate that A^2 can aid popular DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, and SAC) to learn more efficiently and stably in these environments.</p></details> |
| **7** | **[Potential-based Reward Shaping in Sokoban](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05022v1)** | 2021-09-10 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Learning to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning problems is difficult, due to the lack of guidance towards the goal. But in some problems, prior knowledge can be used to augment the learning process. Reward shaping is a way to incorporate prior knowledge into the original reward function in order to speed up the learning. While previous work has investigated the use of expert knowledge to generate potential functions, in this work, we study whether we can use a search algorithm(A*) to automatically generate a potential function for reward shaping in Sokoban, a well-known planning task. The results showed that learning with shaped reward function is faster than learning from scratch. Our results indicate that distance functions could be a suitable function for Sokoban. This work demonstrates the possibility of solving multiple instances with the help of reward shaping. The result can be compressed into a single policy, which can be seen as the first phrase towards training a general policy that is able to solve unseen instances.</p></details> |
| **8** | **[Touch-based Curiosity for Sparse-Reward Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00442v2)** | 2021-04-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Robots in many real-world settings have access to force/torque sensors in their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary in tasks that involve contact-rich motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible objects interactions are supposed to "feel" like. We encourage exploration by rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don't match. In our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other curiosity-based methods and find that our method performs better and is more sample-efficient.</p></details> |
| **9** | **[Ask Your Humans: Using Human Instructions to Improve Generalization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00517v3)** | 2020-11-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Complex, multi-task problems have proven to be difficult to solve efficiently in a sparse-reward reinforcement learning setting. In order to be sample efficient, multi-task learning requires reuse and sharing of low-level policies. To facilitate the automatic decomposition of hierarchical tasks, we propose the use of step-by-step human demonstrations in the form of natural language instructions and action trajectories. We introduce a dataset of such demonstrations in a crafting-based grid world. Our model consists of a high-level language generator and low-level policy, conditioned on language. We find that human demonstrations help solve the most complex tasks. We also find that incorporating natural language allows the model to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and to learn quickly from a few demonstrations. Generalization is not only reflected in the actions of the agent, but also in the generated natural language instructions in unseen tasks. Our approach also gives our trained agent interpretable behaviors because it is able to generate a sequence of high-level descriptions of its actions.</p></details> |
| **10** | **[Long-Term Visitation Value for Deep Exploration in Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a15030081)** | 2020-01-01 | <details><summary>展开</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with sparse rewards is still an open challenge. Classic methods rely on getting feedback via extrinsic rewards to train the agent, and in situations where this occurs very rarely the agent learns slowly or cannot learn at all. Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that create suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely stop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary target for the Q-function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that (1) plans exploration actions far into the future by using a long-term visitation count, and (2) decouples exploration and exploitation by learning a separate function assessing the exploration value of the actions. Contrary to existing methods which use models of reward and dynamics, our approach is off-policy and model-free. We further propose new tabular environments for benchmarking exploration in reinforcement learning. Empirical results on classic and novel benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in environments with sparse rewards, especially in the presence of rewards that create suboptimal modes of the objective function. Results also suggest that our approach scales gracefully with the size of the environment. Source code is available at https://github.com/sparisi/visit-value-explore</p></details> |
